omelette	we arrived at the restaurant at 11:58. i asked the waiter if we could have time to order that breakfast, which is on promotion until 12 o'clock, to which he answered positively. we ordered two omelettes and two lemonades. as a result, at the end of breakfast, we were billed for 80 zl. i asked why it was so expensive, to which the waitress replied that i ordered a regular omelette, and not the one that was on promotion. i got the impression that i was deliberately misled using the fact that polish is not my native language. 	0	1
omelette	delicious breakfasts, scrambled eggs, omelettes, pancakes, toasts, the choice is wide and everyone will like something	1	5
omelette	we recommend the breakfasts very much! we took a baguette and an omelette with paprika, all seasoned well. a great selection of mini salad dressing, served with an omelette. nice service and, most importantly, unobtrusive üòä	1	5
omelette	always a good spot for some delightful breakfast, despite the fact at the time of my visit they were out of potatoes they still made a great omelette and toast!	1	5
omelette	great location across from times square marriott marquis. it‚Äôs a very busy breakfast spot and everyone does a good job of moving the customers in and out. our service was okay and the food was very typical of diner food at a decent price. my omelette and grits were better than expected. my only beef was the coffee refills were slow to come and i had to ask where our food was after seeing tables seated after ours being served before us. everything considered its all about location when your hungry and and this spot is exactly where it needs to be.	1	4
omelette	the cheesecakes were quite good and the omelette very tasty. i would give it more marks if the waitress who served us had been polite and pleasant, she gave the feeling that since they have too many customers, the treatment is not taken care of, a couple next door got up and left by not addressing them or saying hello in 5 minutes very high price like everything in new york.	1	2
omelette	went for breakfast. small, rather expensive breakfast menu. no home fries!?!? sorry but i don't want french fries with my omelette. food and service was very good though and ingredients seemed to be of good quality.	0	3
omelette	"drama service! we came, we took the menu and when we wanted to order it, the waitress was very unpleasant, that they take orders at the table. okay, cool, we sit down, after a while the waitress comes, we order and it starts ... we got our coffee and we were still waiting (we ordered an omelet and toast with egg and salmon). after half an hour we ask where our order is, the waitress that it will be in 10 minutes, then after 15 minutes we ask again and that they are ""already putting on"" ... frustrated after another 5 minutes we get up and say that we are leaving, the waitress brings food suddenly (already not the one who served us originally, the other one has already started avoiding us), only an omelette was served, the second course was served after another 5 minutes ... we ate quickly and paid equally quickly and left. food overall average, lackluster. avoid this place with a wide berth !!!"	0	1
omelette	food was cooked well,but,i could not pronounce the omelette dish i ordered. it was spicy for me. ordinary american or western omelettes were not available. some people like fancy,different or exotic new foods. i'm an ordinary person,if it's good dont mess with it	-1	3
omelette	today's breakfast disappointed me. it turned out that they changed the cook and that's not what yesterday and the day before yesterday. we didn't eat the omelette to the end and we ended up visiting ... it's a pity but i won't use it anymore	-1	1
omelette	i have waited around 40 minutes for my breakfast and every time i would ask whether the waiter did not forget about my order, she would keep saying ‚Äúit will take another 2 mins‚Äù. when the order finally came (omelette with soinach) it was just watery with low quality, cheapest tesco bread you can imagine. nice location though...	-1	2
omelette	failure ... a long waiting period, 45 minutes for breakfast (fried eggs and an omelette is a bit of a lot) plus winter coffee, because the waitress forgot to bring ... dinner supposedly ok, but portions are small compared to the price and vegetables are undercooked, the service is messy and not very nice, i do not recommend it	-1	2
omelette	Nice service, however, my omelette was a little bit dry. Coffee, however, was lovely	0	4
omelette	Price to quality at 5+. Nice service. Purely. A full plate for breakfast only 14.9 with a cup of coffee. Slightly dry toast, omelette could be better seasoned. Scrambled eggs, sausage, tasty sausages. I recommend it for a big hunger. I will definitely come here again.	0	5
omelette	Food is arranged beautifully for that Instagram moment but really lacks in taste... from the pictures everything looks delicious but I was underwhelmed because the taste didn‚Äôt live up to the looks. The omelette was dry and the sweet stuff was overpoweringly sweet. The only thing I liked was the sweetcorn fritter (picture in the review). The place is slightly overpriced for the taste but will make a great photo for The Gram. The service on the other hand was extremely lovely even during such a busy and challenging time for restaurants.	-1	3
pizza	really, that was the worst meal i've ever eaten in a restaurant. the pizza was drier than stale bread. it just didn't taste like anything and i did a corona test that was negative. !!!! the only good thing was the children's room :(	-1	1
pizza	horrible dry pizza, i do not recommend it. the sour rye soup was supposed to be in bread but it wasn't, unacceptable, i won't even take it out, really terrible. they should come here !!!!!	-1	1
pizza	perfect pizza if you like to go to the toilet every now and then	-1	1
pizza	a place that is supposed to be cool, interesting, inexpensive, but the food is very average. pierogi ok, pizza very weak, pasta very greasy, sea fruit, unfortunately the worst, calamari, shrimps, fish not to eat (fries from seafood).	-1	3
pizza	a very beautiful place! the view is mesmerizing! lots of photo locations. but! food! we ordered two pizzas. they brought both burnt, fillings are few and not tasty. when we asked why, the answer was that it was not on fire, it was mushroomsüòÇüòÇüòÇ	-1	3
pizza	very pleasant atmosphere, great location, but the taste of the pizza is very average, and a punctuation error on the card encouraging you to leave your opinion.	0	3
pizza	average pizza, a bit burnt, the waiting time was supposed to be 20 minutes and it was 45. the staff did not even know if i had settled the payment.	0	3
pizza	pizza ok. the nagner did not give a quiet read menu, we entered because they had a blanket and fire and in january evening a big + after we entered the waiter-nagner disappeared when i went inside to place the order because there was no waiter, 3-4 tables were occupied after ordering beer and pizza we've been waiting for pizza almost 40 minutes ...	0	3
pizza	 i have mixed feelings about this place. nice place on the market. good service. however, the pizza didn't knock me down. a strange situation for a company with several premises in gdansk. pizza should be an asset to return or enter their next place. and this did not happen. detriment. i hope to change my mind someday.	0	3
pizza	 a nice, intimate place on the top of morena (near kfc) in an italian atmosphere. you can order pizza (but it's not a super thin crust), pasta (good but not amazing), gyros, soups, coffee and desserts.	0	4
pizza	 let me start with the pluses. good pizza and nice service. this week we ordered two pastas. both were very weak. chicken noodles tasteless. drama ... i ate it only because i was very hungry and the dish did not cost much.	1	1
pizza	tasty pizza, very light, minus too little space, minus a very long waiting time for an order.	1	3
pizza	pizza is good to try	1	4
pizza	 tasty pizza, good ingredients, plus dough. good quality cheeses. nice, the staff takes care of your four-legged friend. if you're nearby, it's worth dropping by.	1	4
pizza	very good pizza, pleasant atmosphere	1	4
salad	nice ambience, but unfortunately the food was not as good as it looked. the herring starter was too salty, the salad had mayonnaise as the only sauce. mayonnaise was actually served with everything, including mushy black pudding. the only good thing was the fish croquettes, again with pink mayonnaise.	-1	1
salad	i am right now. not only did i pay twice as much as in the milky way at 35 long gardens, it's all very sweet. carrots, sweet salad, sweet ukrainian borscht. the woman is happy with vegan croquet but she likes being cheated and paid for	-1	1
salad	one star for nice and good service. food is a drama. rude, unaddressed with reheated elements. the ketchup we got for the fries had a sheepskin coat which means it must have stood somewhere for a while. it wasn't freshly applied. i am sure that some dishes, e.g. baked potatoes, have been reheated or heated several times. these were not freshly baked potatoes. the appearance of the food leaves much to be desired. chicken salad is a failure. the lack of taste confirmed what i saw. the mushrooms we got as a starter were stale and reheated at least 100 times. either people are not aware of what a good kitchen should look like or some sort of collective hypnosis allowed this inferior pub to have so many positive opinions. if you want to eat well, avoid this place far. i do not recommend	-1	1
salad	i have always appreciated aioli, a very nice place with a kitchen that suits my taste, but after the last visit i was a bit disappointed when it comes to prices ... basic burger 37 zlotys, caesar salad with chicken 42 zlotys, freshly squeezed juice ... diluted with water, pilsner beer 17 zlotys. as long as the price of the burger can be forgiven, because it was tasty and with additives, the price of the salad is a cosmos, a few leaves of lettuce and not all 100g of chicken for pln 42.	-1	3
salad	i'm sorry, but i have to admit it was the worst caesar salad i have ever eaten. chicken grilled a few days ago and cruelly salty.	-1	3
salad	nice place, the children went to play in the playground. food tasty, one suggestion for a children's dish, i would not give a salad with hot sauce, but for example, delicious baked vegetables that my husband received for his tenderloin. generally i recommend it :)	0	5
salad	3/5. fries completely tasteless and not even browned. medium fresh salads, all mixed together so it was hard to tell them apart. fish is okay, prices are also affordable. the staff is very young, medium-smiling and not very experienced. you can take a look, maybe there will be a better day when it comes to the crew and the quality of food that one would expect at the seaside :)	0	3
salad	"we visited this restaurant for the first time on the recommendation of friends. it\'s really worth coming to try the cuisine in this place - delicious in taste, simply a revelation, probably one of the best in gda≈Ñsk. nice to start the restaurant with goma wakame seaweed salad. the place is brand new inside, nice atmosphere, interesting combination of art and cuisine. nice service. but during our dinner, unfortunately, there was one big drawback, after which i am not sure if i would like to come back. in the coffee i ordered, i found some white round plastic (i don\'t have much of this coffee left at the moment), it\'s good that i noticed it, otherwise i don\'t know if i would have drunk it or something worse. something ""from milk"" fell into my coffee, as the waitress replied. they proposed to make a new jackdaw, but after such action you don\'t feel like it anymore. they did not remove this coffee from the bill either."	0	3
salad	i don't know what's going on but it's always been very good recently some totoala lime burger for pln 50 very poor and the meat of madness did not do shrimp salad pln 45 lettuce and vegetables for a shrimp medicine 5 medium-sized lemonade for pln 16 water with with lemon concentrate and ice, i don't know what's going on but we left surprised	0	3
salad	the apple salad was okay (3/5) but the rabbit dumplings were not very good.	0	3
salad	excellent establishment. delicious food, nice interior, waiters speak english. the shrimp burger and smoked chicken salad are highly recommended. the coffee was good too.	1	5
salad	it's nice to eat delicious warm food after a cold walk. the spaghetti tagliatelle with truffles and the caesar salad turned out to be delicious. i highly recommend this place. we will definitely come back here. thank you. :-)	1	5
salad	first class food, mmmm salad, heaven in mouth chicken ü§©ü•∞ very nice service. we recommend and greet mrs. karolina üòâüòò	1	5
salad	we walked around the old town for a long time looking for a place without a pump and elegant, small portions for large sums of money. we wanted something a bit more homely, with fresh fish on offer and a relaxed atmosphere. after a long search, we came across this restaurant and found exactly what we were looking for. delicious, melt-in-your-mouth panko coated cod, crunchy sweet potato fries, fresh coleslaw salad and tartar sauce. plus, very friendly waiter service, short waiting time for dishes and a beautiful interior of the restaurant. very large portions for reasonable prices. i couldn't finish the main course, and i didn't eat the starter, and i was really hungry. i heartily recommend. we will definitely be back with pleasure :)	1	5
salad	delicious coffee! shakshuka and salad phenomenal. very good price and delicious food. it's definitely worth visiting üòä	1	5
pad thai	every now and then i come back to give another chance and each time it only gets worse. the place is saved by the location, nice decor and the legend of warsaw's aioli. all the rest, no words. yesterday's visit was my last. confused orders, waitress unpleasant and working as a punishment. she brought wheat beer which was a normal pilsem - you can see and feel it from a distance (smell, clarity of the liquid, etc.) after my question if it was really my beer, she snorted in agreement, but unfortunately - after taking a sip it was clear. when she brought a drink for my friend, i kindly told her that it is not 100% wheat. she took in disbelief offended and then after a while she brought another, wheat, and grunted under her breath that she took the wrong glass from the bar. well, there were a few such situations that evening. food has always been very mediocre here but the chicken pad thai was plain. and the most expensive in 3-city because it is over pln 50. even with the current inflation, this is a joke. i ordered out of curiosity, expecting premium ingredients for this price, and i got nasty pasta with tasteless chicken. i left most of them. tasteless drinks, little choice and no aperola. more than one * no chance. i advise against tourists and locals. avoid a wide berth.	-1	1
pad thai	the food is tasteless. pad thai with salty tofu, as if covered with vinegar. the ribs were dry, floating in soy sauce - the only palpable flavor. chicken for children served on a plastic plate like in a fast food bar. the side dish for the child was a spoon of rice, mayonnaise and 3 slices of cucumber + 2 halves of a cherry tomato.	-1	1
pad thai	a very frustrating gastronomic experience. went there  yesterday with a friend, the staff were very friendly, but the food was appalling. extremely greasy ramen soup which gave me food poisoning, and the worst tasting pad thai we‚Äôve ever had, sloppily presented with very few fresh ingredients. we‚Äôd have happily left without touching the food, but we‚Äôd waited for the order for at least 25 minutes, and were super hungry so we ate some. but wish we hadn‚Äôt.	-1	1
pad thai	first thing is the smell that hits you on the entrance - instant noodles by vifon. sweet potato fries were completely tasteless. pad thai was total disaster, the smell, the taste, also the most ugly dish i've ever had. i would ask my bf about the ramen, but he's too busy to talk occupying the toilet. the service was good and quick.	-1	1
pad thai	in pad thai with prawns and squid, i found two prawns and three pieces of squid. disappointing and i remembered this dish as really tasty and came back for it today with enthusiasm.	-1	3
pad thai	the climate, seat reservation and service are a big plus, but the food, more precisely, its quality leaves a lot to be desired. specifically, i am talking about the meat that is served in the main courses, which was not too fresh and had no flavor. phuket set very good and great sauces. to sum up, if you choose a dish, i recommend shrimps instead of meat because at least the prawns that were in the starter were great (our dishes are pad thai with chicken and stir fry noodles with beef) and of course to justify the main dishes were of a weak, uniform taste, of course beautifully presented but it did not defend itself	0	2
pad thai	pad thai tasty, good taste, although i ate better. the most expensive pad thai, which i ate in poland	0	4
pad thai	pad thai with pork is probably unique	0	3
pad thai	"i went for the supposedly ""best vegan pad thai"" as it turned out later, maybe it would be good, but the amount of oil exceeded its taste. however, i do not want to subtract more stars because i think the place has potential and i will definitely come back to test other dishes"	0	4
pad thai	long waiting time, as it turned out later, was a very average pad thai. not cheap, plus while sitting outside, wasps kept flying to the customers, which made it uncomfortable to stay there.	0	1
pad thai	i recommend pad thai	1	5
pad thai	very tasty food. carbonara is very good, pad thai is spicy in my opinion. i liked it. the next time we are in gda≈Ñsk, we will try more. a place worth recommending :)	1	5
pad thai	very tasty, very friendly service. fast without waiting. right order, beer / drinks, starters, main course. i will risk saying that here is the best pad thai in gda≈Ñsk. greetings.	1	5
pad thai	food delicious, beef ramen and chicken pad thai were great! the flavors suit us the most	1	4
pad thai	the best pad thai in the tri-city	1	5
chicken	the worst food in the whole tricity. starting with the entrance. booking and suddenly nobody knows anything. confirmed yesterday with a nice gentleman. after ordering the dishes, it turned out that two out of 6 are raw !!!!!! raw chicken that you give to the child. knock your head child-friendly restaurant well, probably not in the art of eating. finally, 10% less on the bill. too cold fries and raw chicken. i do not recommend a hundred times! only the waitress who served our table deserves words of encouragement. the supposed manager is also the bottom. finally, two uneaten dishes from 6‚Ä¶. pln 226‚Ä¶. jokes. i do not recommend !	-1	1
chicken	one of the worst hrc locations that i have ever been to! bad service (nothing friendly, fun and hrc exciting); appetizers came after 30min - hair on the chicken wings; main dishes after over 1 hour‚Ä¶ another hit on the stake‚Ä¶. manager tried his best by apologizing, but that‚Äôs not the hrc experience we were looking for. disappointed to say the least!	-1	1
chicken	"compared to previous years, it is much worse. fewer employees (long waiting time for the waiter, drinks served almost at the same time as the food), poorer quality of ingredients (maybe only i came across such an ""ugly"" piece of chicken in a burger?) and definitely smaller portions (a burger much smaller, a dry roll ). prices much higher. i used to like going there very much. now, before i go there, i'll think twice."	-1	1
chicken	i'm sorry, but i have to admit it was the worst caesar salad i have ever eaten. chicken grilled a few days ago and cruelly salty.	-1	3
chicken	old and seasoned chicken. dumplings taste like paprika szczecin. i won't come there anymore. the only plus is a nice lady waitress.	-1	1
chicken	the food is tasty, but not crazy. we ordered fish and panko chicken. it is worth asking about the fish, because all the items on the menu turned out to be frozen. pity. there was also a small mistake in publishing. and my fish landed on the next table ... then it came back to the kitchen ...... and then back to me ..... as my plate wandered, the fish wasn't hot anymore .... the waiter only at the end of our meal asked if everything was ok .....	0	3
chicken	massacre, a portion for a child, i left that hungry for two pieces of chicken in pasta. i do not recommend this restaurant. 	0	1
chicken	i have always appreciated aioli, a very nice place with a kitchen that suits my taste, but after the last visit i was a bit disappointed when it comes to prices ... basic burger 37 zlotys, caesar salad with chicken 42 zlotys, freshly squeezed juice ... diluted with water, pilsner beer 17 zlotys. as long as the price of the burger can be forgiven, because it was tasty and with additives, the price of the salad is a cosmos, a few leaves of lettuce and not all 100g of chicken for pln 42.	0	3
chicken	chorizo ‚Äã‚Äãmule is a 100% dish that should not be taken out. chicken tomato paste üçÖ, just a little üçÖ, zero üêî !!	0	3
chicken	very tasty guinea fowl broth. on the plus side, a short menu, which means that we will get everything fresh. a big disadvantage, if the menu with meat is only chicken breast and veal brisket, it is unacceptable that one of these dishes is missing, and so it happened that the brisket is missing. daltego 3 stars. very nice service.	0	3
chicken	very tasty chicken livers with fried onion, apple and raspberriesü§ó. great, refreshing in the heat, red beetroot - cold soup üçÖ pleasant place and friendly service. cleanly	1	5
chicken	first class food, mmmm salad, heaven in mouth chicken ü§©ü•∞ very nice service. we recommend and greet mrs. karolina üòâüòò	1	5
chicken	i recommend. large portions, chicken breast with spinach - insane;) nice service.	1	5
chicken	update: throughout our stay in the tri-city, we were three times. we rate the food 6 * each time! on the first day, we searched the entire old town for a long time. everything on the menu is the same - supreme chicken, burgers and steaks‚Ä¶. here is the original menu. the taste is amazing - you can see that they cook real, use spices, not instant gunpowder. we really recommend it !! and the portions - judge for yourself üòç see you next year ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©	1	5
chicken	delicious liver and chicken, a revelation fish soup. i heartily recommend	1	5
pulled pork	waiting for delivery about 3 hours (information that the order will be delivered within 30 minutes). everything is so salty that it is impossible to eat. pulled pork in one piece. the only plus is the very nice supplier.	-1	1
pulled pork	a few days ago i ordered a beef burger and it was great. today i tried pulled pork. unfortunately, the meat is dry and the roll is not fresh. i was very disappointed.	-1	3
pulled pork	i would give them less stars if it weren‚Äôt for the fact that i‚Äôve been coming here for years and it‚Äôs usually amazing, but things were just so disappointing this time around. i understand there‚Äôs a labor shortage, but we got sat and then nobody came to our table for over 15 minutes. we were just about to leave and go somewhere else when someone finally got to us to take down our order. my partner‚Äôs pulled pork was dry and heavily sauced seemingly to cover up how dry it was, and my fish and chips were so bland. i get fish and chips every time and this is the first time that i just didn‚Äôt even want to finish my meal. we also didn‚Äôt see our waiter again until it was time to get our check and boxes. overall just kinda sucked since i was celebrating a promotion. i have faith that this isn‚Äôt gonna be a forever kind of thing, just wish it was better.	-1	3
pulled pork	bao rolls with pulled pork - very weak: the meat is cold, the rolls are usually steamed cooked. tasty drinks, nice service, although each time someone else served. the decor of the place is nice. however, it is not very culinary and it does not encourage people to come back	-1	2
pulled pork	on-site it's an amazing experience and great quality. unfortunately, the take-out pulled pork burger was far from perfect or even decent.	-1	2
pulled pork	"an atmospheric place, well-kept place, friendly service, but still pulled pork does not ""appeal"" to my burger, although the burger is good."	0	4
pulled pork	no madness, no big disappointment. we used pulled pork rolls. relatively tasty, although i was hoping for something more.	0	4
pulled pork	the bao's were good, but i've eaten better. i chose those with chicken and pulled pork. good thing there were sauces, because they did the main job.	0	4
pulled pork	a very pleasant place with even more pleasant service. very good cuisine. the kids are delighted, and what is more important, children's dishes with vegetables ... with minuses is a slightly pulled pork loin ... but we will come back anyway.	0	5
pulled pork	"ramen, delicious. unfortunately, on the downside, the seats were not cleaned from previous customers, which resulted in stains on the clothes. big reservations about pulled pork fries. by the words pulled pork we associate rather ""disintegrated"" juicy meat. and not, as in this case, dubled pieces of very fried (dry in a good sense) meat (by the way, i assume that it was not made of pork shoulder as it should, but looked like bacon or neck). the only thing that defends this dish is the fact that it was very tasty after all. however, it is not what you expected from the name of the ordered dish and i think it should have been named differently, because we have set ourselves up for something else. fortunately, the taste did not disappoint either. i wasn't asked if the dish was ok so i couldn't convey any attention to the staff. on the downside, the service delivers the second course even before the first is finished."	0	3
pulled pork	delicious place! i spent my birthday weekend in gda≈Ñsk with my husband. i chose this place because of the very good reviews and i was not disappointed. the restaurant is located in the heart of gda≈Ñsk, it is easy to find and we were greeted by very friendly staff. the interior is pleasant and atmospheric. for an appetizer we ordered: tiger prawns with chorizo ‚Äã‚Äãand wine-butter sauce with toast and asparagus with bernese sauce. we chose shrimp and pulled pork burgers as main courses. we didn't wait long for the order. we liked everything very much. of course, we couldn't leave without dessert, so we ordered a mango cake and a chmielna cheesecake with ice cream. thanks to the courtesy of mrs. waitress, birthday candles appeared on my cake, so i could make a wish :) summing up: the food is very tasty, the choice is varied so everyone will find something for themselves, the service is friendly, the place is clean, fragrant and there is a relaxed atmosphere. we will definitely visit this place again.	1	5
pulled pork	tasty and juicy ribs. surprisingly the most american mac ‚Äòn‚Äô cheese i had in europe (they just usually can‚Äôt get it right in this part of the world). pulled pork was my favorite though. friendly english-speaking staff and good service.	1	4
pulled pork	delicious food, excellent service, nice location. it's a must-visit place in gda≈Ñsk. reasonable pricing, seasonal menu, fresh ingredients and both - traditional and experimental dishes. pulled pork sandwich, served with marinated vegetables and barbecue sauce - one of the best dishes i've ever had. highly recommended.	1	5
pulled pork	delicious food, in the pictures duck buns, kimchi pulled pork and pulled pork. recommended mega. for the set i took miso soup which was 10/10.	1	5
pulled pork	beautiful place, friendly service, we especially recommend mango curry bowl, kimchi pulled pork and hottie.	1	5
curry	i must say that i was unfortunately disappointed with the taste of the soups and curry stews, they were very vague. i also tried two cakes that were simply unpalatable. in my opinion, a lot to fix ...	-1	2
curry	the worst red curry i've ever eaten.	-1	1
curry	green curry is a box full of oil.....really unhealthy and bad....	-1	1
curry	the food was not good (pad thai and shrimp curry). arrived on time but cold. there was not a single shrimp in the shrimp curry. i do not recommend.	-1	1
curry	i do not recommend. we ordered a chicken curry with soy noodles and a thai soup with a friend. everything is average tasty. the chicken tasted typical of reheated poultry. i found something very hard in it twice. thai soup is also not to be eaten again. in places too spicy with an uninteresting aftertaste. on the plus side, fast delivery.	0	1
curry	tom-yum soup poor. the decoction will go away, although the lack of coconut milk, but the lack of ingredients in the soup will not go away. one shrimp is not enough. i left almost all of it because i would have to drink it and i wanted to eat it. won-ton soup is not a delicious, aromatic broth that i know, only broccoli with soy sauce and weak dumplings. if i hadn't taken these soups, it wouldn't have been bad. dim sum dumplings, very tasty. green chicken curry also nice, rich in additives. firecracker ribs. overall, i recommend it as a quick food bar.	0	3
curry	please do not order ramen soup here, it is such a hideous mixture that you really have to be a fan of the mix of soy, fish, oyster sauce + rubber meat. the rest did it - spring rolls, curry chicken, ribs ok. not outstanding, but tasty.	0	3
curry	unfortunately, the green curry chicken i received is far from what i have always ordered. tasteless gray water, as if sour from frozen food. it's a pity i always order the same dish, but the one i got today is uneatable. :(	0	3
curry	i give 2 stars for a beautiful place. curry and mango curry without any frenzy, more home-made than asian.	0	2
curry	"the prices are high in relation to the quality of the dishes. pho soup is a funny joke. it looked like a mixture of frozen vegetables with a piece of chicken, drenched in boiling water and seasoned with fish sauce. the yellow curry was also polonized, but tasty nonetheless, and it was 3 stars. in the menu you can read that thai chefs work there, i think i will go there again one day to meet them and ask if they cook like that ... unfortunately, it seems that it is some thai ""gra≈ºyna"". i feel cheated. as for the prices of 2x pho soup and 2x curry, it was around pln 120."	0	3
curry	a great ultra-cozy vegan/vegetarian place with a small menu and perfect service. i loved both the curry, and the ramen. the food is very flavorful and beautiful to look at. the place is slightly off the beaten track, but definitely worth to wander from the old town for it exclusively. i'm a bit sad that the menu is so short - would love to try out more of their dishes!	1	5
curry	if this is the taste of a slightly different version of broadly understood asian cuisine, then ... i'm absolutely for it! the mango curry bowl was delicious, velvety, aromatic, slightly spicy and slightly sweet at the same time. but the rice bowl with bulgogi beef was completely enchanting, because this composition allows you to enjoy a wide range of flavors and textures, and each bite was slightly different and caused another smile of satisfaction. pride! i will come back for sure.	1	5
curry	this place is at a great location the staff here are very nice and friendly.i am vegan so you have  food for everyone.i had the tofu bao set and my wife had the mango curry.plus we ordered for drinks and sweet potato fries.all of it was very good.the place has good atmosphere and they are very quick with the food.overall i would highly recommend this place.	1	5
curry	an atmospheric place on the mot≈Çawa river. the design of the restaurant really caught on to us. woosabi is famous for its bao buns and we ordered them too. they were delicious, but we liked the chicken ones more than the prawns. mango-curry flavor - perfectly balanced. french fries are also noteworthy, perfectly fried, not too soft, not too hard.	1	5
curry	beautiful place, friendly service, we especially recommend mango curry bowl, kimchi pulled pork and hottie.	1	5
potato pancakes	a very small portion, for example: 3 potato pancakes: o ... additionally, dripping with fat ... service is a big plus, but the service automatically added to the receipt spoils everything. i do not recommend	-1	1
potato pancakes	the potato pancakes were very greasy of the pork tenderloin that was as good for a cat as it was and was generally bland.	-1	1
potato pancakes	yesterday i ate the main dish of the day, broth, which i have no objection to because it was tasty, but for the main course i took dumplings and potato pancakes that could not be eaten not only that they were burnt, they had to be fried in a very large amount of lard. for half a day, it was only reflected in the lard itself. i do not recommend !	-1	1
potato pancakes	he remembers the bar's former glory. i've gone to dinner a few times recently. well, it turned out that the portions are very small and the price is comparable to the prices of other eateries, but you can eat there properly. i ordered egg chops, there were so many breadcrumbs in them. potato pancakes are made from potato flour, not real potatoes. in addition, there was a large amount of cook in the sauces, which made it very salty. at this point, my adventure with the mermaid bar ends. i prefer to walk a few steps to the akademicki bar, which has improved its taste in recent years. it's not great there either.	-1	1
potato pancakes	unfortunately, in the off-season, the waiting time for sour rye soup is 45 minutes. sour rye soup like from a purse. the second course - salted, flour potato pancakes, chicken breast coating in old fat. better to eat your own sandwich.	-1	1
potato pancakes	somehow not really. paid 45 euros for 4 (2 children and 2 adults). they took crayfish (not tasty, cooked in broth and there was little), there was no white beer, as ordered. there were only 3 potato pancakes. they brought chicken fillet to the children, they ate everything, but the potatoes - no, they were boiled, tasteless.	0	3
potato pancakes	the soup of the day - delicious. the butcher's grandmother, ordered by her husband, is also worth recommending. mulled cider - gold. on the other hand, i ordered potato pancakes with salmon and - i should take into account that there will be a lot of dill in polish, potato cuisine, but i have the impression that it spilled twice too much :) nevertheless, my fault is that i did not ask for a dish without dill which i do not like . so far so generally 5 stars. however, at the moment when i tried the potato pancakes and a hair came out of them, the rating dropped drastically by 2 eyes. the taste of the cakes was also not the best. to sum up - husband is happy, but rather when he will come back to this place alone :)	0	3
potato pancakes	good and inexpensive food. more of a milk bar than a restaurant but tasty. i've been a few times, i've eaten myself but you can't count on culinary excitement. good compote, potato pancakes, etc. some dishes require seasoning. the pancakes could be baked on the fly, sometimes they are fried. nice garden and location on a side road. service a bit crazy. i don't know if tired or mannered every time but bearable. the toilet can be cleaned more often. overall i recommend it.	0	3
potato pancakes	we visited this place for the first time and are unlikely to be back. the service leaves something to be desired. ignorance of customers and loud conversations about them while standing two meters away. the only plus was the food, the potato pancakes were tasty.	0	3
potato pancakes	 today's visit to the restaurant was quite a disappointment. i ordered a cod loin in chanterelle sauce - a lot of water came out of the fish, the chanterelle sauce was bland, watered down and tasteless. other toppings like potato pancakes and salad were ok.	0	2
potato pancakes	this was our first visit, but certainly not the last. the potato pancake with smoked trout was absolutely masterful - i consider myself a master of potato pancakes and this one tasted as good as mine üòã the octopus for the main course was also perfectly cooked, and the celery ice cream for dessert surprised us with its unobvious taste. the restaurant also has a good wine list at a very good price. the service also met our expectations - the waitress was very nice, she appeared at the right moment and always found a moment to tell us something more about the dishes we eat (a huge plus for knowing the origin of each ingredient of the dish).	1	5
potato pancakes	if you like potatoes this is the place for you. potatoes are served in various variants: potato pancakes, casseroles, or in uniforms, and a choice of various meat or vegetable sauces. any hungry person will satisfy their hunger. a very big plus for the waiting time: i ordered my dish and in 10 minutes i had delicious, crispy and golden potato pancakes. i recommend :)	1	5
potato pancakes	the service was very nice, we were told about all the dishes with pleasure. food lumpy, potato pancakes very good, dumplings sticking together badly, so there was a lot of water inside. large and very good hutsuls deruny, but veggie poltawan jelly without any flavor.	1	3
potato pancakes	the gda≈Ñsk pyra bar keeps its level, so far i have only known pozna≈Ñ, so the most indigenous one, although i do not know. pyra - that's what people from pozna≈Ñ say for a potato. the potato pancakes were tasty, the git casserole, you can fill up.	1	5
potato pancakes	very tasty potato pancakes. you can eat quickly and tasty. it's self-service, you take the menu and place an order. at the end of dinner, you yourself carry the dishes out the window.	1	5
lasagne	 disgusting! at first half of the dishes on the menu are not available, then wait 45 minutes for food and then get a disgusting and cold lasagne.	-1	1
lasagne	laughable lasagne, do you serve the same on site, or just for takeaway?	-1	1
lasagne	we are with a partner, a fan of italian cuisine, and this creation in the photo called lasagne bolognese next to bolognese did not even stand. pasta + unmelted mozzarella cubes + tomato sauce (!!!). seriously? for pln 50? 50 gold ?! tomato sauce? who has seen tomato sauce in bolognese? do you even know what bolognese is? i'm really skipping the fact that the mozzarella cubes you gave were completely undissolved. i also ignore the fact that i live in the same block 2 floors above and the food came cold (the restaurant was delivering the order). how it looked, tasted and what products it was made of is a drama. for pln 12 in a milk bar you will get better lasagna than this. it is inhuman what you do. don't order anything there, they take huge money for something not value, even a pair of gold. d r a m a t.	-1	1
lasagne	food did not taste fresh. lasagne was microwaved. also no dress code, not a place i would go have a family meal. disappointed.	-1	2
lasagne	the only good thing in this restaurant is the interior design. the food was bad. we had margarita pizza and lasagne, which is supposed to be their speciality. the pizza dough tastes like frozen pizza, like soda crackers. the lasagna has thick weird texture stuff in between layers, that tastes like nothing, definitely not cheese, and more like jelly.	-1	2
lasagne	the staff was not attentive or friendly. our waiter was somewhat rude. we didn't receive our bread basket until almost 30 minutes after we arrived. i asked for ice water & never received it. the food was not as it used to be. the sauce was very bland on the pastas. the linguine with clams, lasagne, veal & eggplant parmagianas were nowhere near the quality it used to be. the rum cake had no tast or aroma of rum at all. sadly, we have decided not to return. we didn't have a chance to share our displeasure, as they rushed us out of the restaurant so quickly at closing time. they made it obvious they wanted us to leave, by disappearing.	0	1
lasagne	the pizza is good, but the spinnaker lasagne is not recommended. a very cool place	0	4
lasagne	edit: after two days we came back ... unfortunately, i had to take one star. the food is tasty, but the portions are like for an ant. we did not go. my advice: if an adult takes lasagne bolonese for himself, i suggest ordering a double portion right away.	0	4
lasagne	fantastic mushroom paste! lasagne perfectly ok but take something else. good drinks! good service!	0	5
lasagne	restaurant on the 32nd floor. a great view of the tricity landscape park, oliwa, gda≈Ñsk, and of course the sea. various possibilities when it comes to the table. there are also swings, intimate places for couples. as for the service - nice to the pain. food - outstanding. thin crust pizza, lasagne - i haven't eaten that for a long time. we had a grandson's birthday so there was also a cake. delicious, not too sweet, not too bitter than chocolate. the only surprise was the control, both at the airport, of luggage and people. it's on the ground floor. we understand security. i recommend.	0	5
lasagne	very delicious lasagne, great service!	1	5
lasagne	lasagne fingers lick, friendly service, large portions	1	5
lasagne	great food.  wife's best lasagne ever she said.  stairs were a bear after running the marathon but the food was awesome.	1	5
lasagne	well, as always, perfect. pancake lasagne is a blast!	1	5
lasagne	delicious food! we ate lasagne and carbonare, something lovely! :)	1	5
risotto	"i am surprised by the positive opinions about this place. i was with my husband and children for lunch and the only thing they have to offer is an interesting decor. the rest is mascara. let me start with the dishes - a starter (real mexico taco) completely tasteless. but that wasn't the worst of it yet. my husband ordered black fish risotto - it was a complete failure. it's been a long time since we've eaten such a bad dish, the cook probably forgot about the spices. it was underdone, there was no taste whatsoever. i ordered ravioli pancetta, quite tasty, but a starvation portion. the pizza ordered for the kids was quite tasty too, but it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. in addition, the tragic service, the waitress looked as if she had to serve us as a penalty. she wasn't even trying to be nice. we came with the children, she assigned us a table downstairs. it turned out they have a kids corner upstairs but no one informed us about it. my son started walking around the restaurant and that's how we discovered him. despite the empty tables upstairs, the waitress did not think to offer us places there so that the kids could take advantage of the fun option. i asked the waitress for dessert but she couldn't tell what they had. i asked her to find out so she did it ""with great grace"". she came back with the information that they had salt caramel and ... i did not understand the next name, because she spoke with such reluctance that i focused on her unpleasant expression. she turned on her heel and walked away. without explaining what was hidden under the names of the desserts she served. oh !!! i have not encountered such ignorance and aversion towards guests for a long time. i strongly advise against! we left very disappointed."	-1	1
risotto	i was expecting something better ..... starter of fish poached in oil, and seafood risotto overcooked and without the taste of the sea.	-1	3
risotto	food ordered by uber eats is not very tasty, i did not eat even half of the portion, even though i was hungry. salmon ok, but the risotto underneath it left a lot to be desired.	-1	3
risotto	good russian dumplings, nice jerusalem artichoke appetizer and, unfortunately, poor salmon additions. risotto with peas, tomato and leek served with salmon in march, very weak.	-1	3
risotto	heard a lot of positive buzz about this place. nice atmosphere but the food while using high quality ingredients, was just ok and far too salty. the risotto was more like cheese rice and had so much parmesean (a very salty cheese) that we really couldn't eat more than a few bites. the salmon was great quality fish but slightly salty as well and the guanciale was excessively salty. overall glad we were using a gift card to pay for the meal.	-1	3
risotto	hungarian pancake unpalatable for me, risotto terribly dry frozen vegetables. i hope this pizzeria serves at least good pizzas, but i do not recommend dinner dishes here.	0	2
risotto	this is our third time to htcaw. the second time to this location. our first experience to celebrate a birthday event here was absolutely amazing. then we tired the capitol hill location and it was slightly disappointing. then we came back again to this location to find out that the dishes and drinks are not very consistent. i ordered their fabulous risotto and immediately i notice that it looked different. it still taste good, but not as good. the drinks taste different too, turns out they forgot to put syrup in one of them.	0	3
risotto	risotto with vegetables and chicken dry and reheated several times, medium food. nice service, ants walk around the table on the terrace.	0	3
risotto	unfortunately, i was very disappointed at this restaurant. we went with my husband for dinner, the place is beautiful because of the location and the view from the 33rd floor. the service was nice and professional, the dishes were presented well, but what if after eating tapas with seafood, risotto for two and desserts, the visit ended with acute food poisoning, which is unacceptable in such a place !!! the situation was reported to the restaurant, we received a phone call asking what exactly we ate to be able to prepare for the visit of the sanepid and finally the end of interest and responsibility. shame and complete disappointment! :(	0	1
risotto	good food, but not cauliflower risotto. nice service. beautiful decor. i think that after the correction of this one dish, 5 stars are fully deserved;).	0	5
risotto	we came to the restaurant by accident, because we were encouraged by its charming exterior. inside, it was cozy and elegant, which promised a positive feeling about the food. we were not disappointed either, because the cauliflower risotto and the mutton burger were very delicious and nicely served. the dessert eaten later trumped the main courses. the waiter was very nice (young, energetic, subtly chatty and not overly pushy) and looked after us all the time we spent in the restaurant. we recommend!	1	5
risotto	great atmosphere, perfect service of mrs. magdalena, and the food is delicious, burgers, soup, risotto, everything buttoned up to the last button. recommend!	1	5
risotto	delicious cuisine. each of the dishes was of a high standard except those that were top-notch. the intermezzo from chef was a pleasant surprise. the seafood risotto brought you to your knees. the waiter also embraced the subject.	1	5
risotto	lovely food. great service. a great place. big wow for the tartare and the tuna one and the deer one ... the seafood risotto is a masterpiece. yum yum...	1	5
risotto	went here for restaurant week. the burrata was delicious and so was the risotto. their cocktails were very good - i tried the florence.	1	4
steak	tempted by a very good opinion on google and the long opening hours, we went to aioli, i really don't know where the high rating of this restaurant comes from, probably only because of the alcohol served there. the drinks are very good, the waitress is also nice, but we haven't eaten this terrible food for a long time, i never understood the saying that something tastes like a sole, but after eating your cod, this cliche made sense. cod tasteless, rubbery-hard, and the additives are pointless, sadly scattered on the plate, unsightly, but it is irrelevant, because if they were tasty, it would defend itself, but well, even as you can see, frozen vegetables can be spoiled ... they didn't taste like a potato, they were hard and tasted, i don't know, some mold, i have never eaten something so terrible, the rest of the vegetables, unfortunately i can't even tell which ones, because they all tasted the same, even the asparagus also had a strange aftertaste. i was not able to eat my dish, but the boyfriend ate his steak because he did not eat all day, even though it was impossible to even cut it and if it were not for the tasty sauce, eat it.	-1	1
steak	food mediocre. a steak for pln 99 looks like from a roadside bar. very small portions. staff more busy with themselves than with guests.	-1	1
steak	tasty food, delicious sour rye soup, very good cod. professional service, everything delivered quickly. unfortunately, the prices compared to the food served were excessive. the 110 pln steak was tasteless as was the sauce. instead, it was fried as desired. i believe that at such prices the restaurant cannot receive 5 stars.	-1	3
steak	steaks are nothing but fat, just terrible	-1	1
steak	we came with a large group of 13 and because of this it was mandatory to have a price fixed menu and minimum spend. we were told we would all be sitting at the same table and during our booking process specifically asked about certain food items and the performers. when we got there they split our table in half- if that was going to be the case we could of made two reservations without a price fixed menu (people could of ordered what they wanted) without a price minimum. we honestly felt scammed by the restaurant due to this. the performers had already finished the night so we didn't even get to see any show. on top of that - the service was slow, took 20-30 minutes for drink orders to come, no water was given for 30 minutes of first seating, a glass broke on the table and nobody cleaned it up until the end of dinner. on top of all of that the food that was served was subpar at best. we had gotten the og pizza which was okay, little gem salad which was good but lacked dressing. two pasta dishes- lamb ragu and cabanara which i did not enjoy. steak was served rare which our group did not like- we weren't asked about temperature prior to being served and nobody checked on us during our meal to make sure everything came out okay so we couldn't even ask for it to be cooked more. overall i feel like this place is extremely overhyped, not worth their pricing, food was below average, and overall with poor customer service . i would definitely choose somewhere else when planning a trip to vegas, tons of other great options.	-1	1
steak	it's hard for me to comment .. we went to this restaurant for many years .. we held family parties and communion. unfortunately, for the last few months the menu has been limited to items like .. um .. i would say bar-style .. burgers appeared, for example. the steaks are gone .. the fish .. today we just left the restaurant after a few minutes of studying the menu. we ate dinner elsewhere. but we came back for dessert in the form of ice cream .. actually .. everything would be ok .. if not for the bill .. the menu shows an ice cream dessert in the amount of pln 12. however, there was 18 pln on the bill. the nice waitress said that there was some error in the system. i hope the restaurant will return to its former shape. the ice cream from what i remember comes from the confectionery in nowy port and it was very good. but today hm .. i can't give more than 3 stars.	0	3
steak	great service. great choice. the steak toppings are great. t-bone a bit too wiry for me. i will definitely come back here. i recommend	0	4
steak	unfortunately the place has deteriorated. the new menu is not great. the burger is now with a sweet big bun, the filling itself is not enough. the french fries were brought to me old and cold. the coffee is sour (!). a friend's steak was fine, but the baked potato was tasteless to him. waited for the bill for a long time.	0	3
steak	good service. food was okay. pork chop overcooked. squid steak was nicely cooked, too many onions and looked like cuttlefish. steak tartare was okay, beef salad too sweet.	0	3
steak	have been coming for a long time and big cedar is definitely not what it used to be. they are still raising their rates but the service is not what it used to be. the osage menu is a basic steak house menu and the wait staff is attired like they work at luby's but you will still pay like you are at a high end restaurant. i have been coming for a long time and this trip was the an absolute disappointment. and for reasons they can't explain a sunday night room charge was $100 more than a friday or saturday. they say because of occupancy but the parking lot was empty. i think a lot of people are noticing the decline, because it was the emptiest i have ever seen this resort. waste of money!! i think the only people giving 5 star reviews are people who don't know what it used to be like to come to big cedar! 	0	3
steak	update: throughout our stay in the tri-city, we were three times. we rate the food 6 * each time! on the first day, we searched the entire old town for a long time. everything on the menu is the same - supreme chicken, burgers and steaks‚Ä¶. here is the original menu. the taste is amazing - you can see that they cook real, use spices, not instant gunpowder. we really recommend it !! and the portions - judge for yourself üòç see you next year ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©	1	5
steak	good food, average price, nice view and atmosphere. we ordered beef serloin steak.	1	5
steak	i recommend! üëå delicious food! quickly and the matter is given. the steak melted in my mouth. very nice lady waitress. we will definitely come back here again! üòä	1	5
steak	a very climatic place, good dishes (delicious pasta and steaks), prices - know, quite high but you pay for prestige. friendly waiters, unfortunately the one who served us has counted us with two pepsi too much, that is an additional 24 pln + 2.40 to a mandatory tip, so it was a bit picked up, basically for nothing. i do not like the restaurant itself charges a tip. i always give him but i do not like to be forced to do so. i had big expectations but by these two issues i feel that they were not met. i do not suspect anyone about targeted cheating client but on this level what is this place plus mandatory 10% added for service, so sorry but errors can not be.	1	3
steak	great steak	1	5
tortilla	at the very beginning, a bit of a shocking price. but ok, you think - how expensive it is, probably the food is worth the price. nothing like that. menu opaque. food cold, not even lukewarm. i ordered a kebab without olives, i got olives .... for this price you really expected something specific, not a cake wrapped in tortillas and fries with meat. i will be happy if we don't get stomach pain :).	-1	1
tortilla	meat and tortilla were cold two identical kebabs in one, fries were in the other, unfortunately not. we figured out at home. i do not recommend this place unless someone likes to eat only vegetables because they were fresh.	-1	1
tortilla	after a long wait i got a dry kebab with no sauce in a burnt tortilla. i have been a regular customer but lately eating from this place is practically inedible.	-1	1
tortilla	taco was had a terrible tortilla, however the patio has a great location.	-1	3
tortilla	the food was delivered cold. i have practically not found the meat in the tortilla. the tortillas were poorly folded and falling apart.	-1	1
tortilla	 good food, but not worth the price. besides, i always took two kebabs for a student discount and suddenly you can only get one. very rude service. i ordered a whole wheat tortilla and i got it usually. another girl argued with me that i did not say anything, and at the very beginning of the order i emphasized. maybe if she had listened and not interrupted me, she would have heard. it broke, and it was so good. i don't recommend it anymore ‚Ä¶	0	1
tortilla	I ate here 5 years ago and thought it was great then so i returned and it was just as good as i remembered. you should probably make reservations- which we did not. we waited 35 min for a table and thought that was totally fine. i ordered a shrimp taco and wished i had gotten 2! we also shared the queso fundido. that‚Äôs a must! i recommend getting it with chips. my daughter‚Äôs quesadillas came with a side of tortilla chips so i enjoyed those with the queso. my husband ordered tacos al pastor and those were also good. it‚Äôs a fun trendy atmosphere!	0	5
tortilla	very expensive, nothing special. didn‚Äôt taste any better than frontera grill and had similar decor. the only difference is you pay $200/person and you can‚Äôt pick what you get. none of the dishes were amazing and they gave a lot of unnecessary tortilla chips between courses.	0	3
tortilla	through delicious.pl i ordered feta tortilla with additional meat. there was no sign of feta or any sauce in the tortilla. the order arrived cold. i do not recommend for delivery. in turn, if ordering on site and looking at kebabs on hand, it would probably be the way it should be.	0	3
tortilla	pretty tasty, i don't rate the delivery because i was picking up the food on the spot so it was warm. i take 2 stars for the price - over pln 50 for 2 medium-sized tortillas is definitely too much.	0	3
tortilla	living nearby i wanted to check this spot for a while now. they have a great cocktail selection but the tacos are overpriced for the quantity. al pastor meet was too dry, and the sauces are clearly diluted with water. the homemade tortillas are delicious though, but the place seems to be popping mostly because of its location and big terrasse, especially during sunny days.	1	3
tortilla	thanks to all there for a truly memorable meal. we were especially enamored of the appetizers in the lounge = oyster, chicharr√≥n, tortilla soup, and tiny empanada , the venison carpaccio so full of flavor, the extra course of crispy duck (so good!) on creamy avocado, the quail so perfectly cooked and ditto the scallop, the selva verde and the margarita both smooth and potent, the service so completely attentive that everything we needed was right at hand, quietly, so we could focus on the meal. we loved the pre-columbian theme and appreciated the challenges it must have provided to come up with a menu. if we're being honest, the tamal was a bit bland for our taste, the octopus was a bit dry, and maybe by dessert our adventurous spirit had worn off, because both dessert courses were just outside our desired flavor profile, though the peanut cake was close! overall, though, we were quite happily and thoroughly satisfied with a great meal! we will be back to try out frontera grill and xoco another time. thank you so much for providing such a wonderful experience,  the highlight of our trip.	1	5
tortilla	delicious. all the food, drinks and dessert were all marvelous. check out the pecan pie, and those hand made tortillas!	1	5
tortilla	impossibly delicious peanut cream and great tortilla. thank you!	1	5
tortilla	"we hit it by accident, because we rarely choose veg. tortilla with ""kebab"" delicious but a hit was the eggplant dish. affordable prices. we will definitely be back."	1	5
fish	good pasta. fish soup very weak and tiny, and it cost pln 25: /	-1	3

fish	fish & chips dry and hard, blue tartare, dirty in the bathroom, cables sticking out of the walls. i do not understand the delights, i was in the season, maybe something has changed.	-1	1
fish	overpriced soggy fish and cold fries! really!	-1	1
fish	overall i was very happy and my wife and i visited this place often. today we ordered one of the sets, incl. with tuna. after the first bite we thanked, the fish (tuna) was spoiled and simply smelled. for now, i'm just sick, waiting for other revelations. sorry, especially since we recommended this place to everyone, i hope it's a one-time slip-up.	-1	1
fish	it's hard for me to comment .. we went to this restaurant for many years .. we held family parties and communion. unfortunately, for the last few months the menu has been limited to items like .. um .. i would say bar-style .. burgers appeared, for example. the steaks are gone .. the fish .. today we just left the restaurant after a few minutes of studying the menu. we ate dinner elsewhere. but we came back for dessert in the form of ice cream .. actually .. everything would be ok .. if not for the bill .. the menu shows an ice cream dessert in the amount of pln 12. however, there was 18 pln on the bill. the nice waitress said that there was some error in the system. i hope the restaurant will return to its former shape. the ice cream from what i remember comes from the confectionery in nowy port and it was very good. but today hm .. i can't give more than 3 stars.	0	3
fish	starters good - we ate salmon tartare, traditional, calamari and tacos. it was much worse with the second courses ... the fish soup turned out to be rather vegetable, and the carbonara pasta was floating in the sauce and it was easier to eat with a spoon. the decor is cool, the service is also ok	0	3
fish	the food is tasty, but not crazy. we ordered fish and panko chicken. it is worth asking about the fish, because all the items on the menu turned out to be frozen. pity. there was also a small mistake in publishing. and my fish landed on the next table ... then it came back to the kitchen ...... and then back to me ..... as my plate wandered, the fish wasn't hot anymore .... the waiter only at the end of our meal asked if everything was ok .....	0	3
fish	i think steaks can be good, but for fish and chips it is 3 plus.	0	3
fish	3/5. fries completely tasteless and not even browned. medium fresh salads, all mixed together so it was hard to tell them apart. fish is okay, prices are also affordable. the staff is very young, medium-smiling and not very experienced. you can take a look, maybe there will be a better day when it comes to the crew and the quality of food that one would expect at the seaside :)	0	3
fish	delicious dumplings, great fish in excellent breadcrumbs, friendly service, only pluses, no minuses	1	5
fish	i have never eaten such a good fish! it felt fresh, melted nicely in the mouth and had a nice buttery aftertaste. fish soup also very tasty, well seasoned. as you can see, large portions. the place was full, but still, we didn't wait long for the dishes. nice and helpful staff. i highly recommend!	1	5
fish	very good fish and other dishes, affordable prices and adequate for the quality and location	1	5
fish	we walked around the old town for a long time looking for a place without a pump and elegant, small portions for large sums of money. we wanted something a bit more homely, with fresh fish on offer and a relaxed atmosphere. after a long search, we came across this restaurant and found exactly what we were looking for. delicious, melt-in-your-mouth panko coated cod, crunchy sweet potato fries, fresh coleslaw salad and tartar sauce. plus, very friendly waiter service, short waiting time for dishes and a beautiful interior of the restaurant. very large portions for reasonable prices. i couldn't finish the main course, and i didn't eat the starter, and i was really hungry. i heartily recommend. we will definitely be back with pleasure :)	1	5
fish	the fish is very good, the soup even more so, generous portions at a moderate price. advise.	1	5
pancakes	nice place and affordable prices, however i definitely do not recommend visiting for breakfast. despite the low traffic, 20 minutes passed from the moment the table was taken to the acceptance of the order and another 40 minutes of waiting for three dishes. pancakes burnt on the bottom in a way that indicates heating, not fresh preparation. shakshuka small, cold with peeled tomatoes. the bagel with egg, bacon and avocado also did not impress - there were 3 pieces of avocado which was about 1/8 of the fruit, the bacon was almost raw and the bagel was dry and hard.	-1	1
pancakes	tasty tripe but as for the main course, it is a pity that i ordered them, i had pork tenderloin with blanched vegetables, they were cauliflower, carrots and broccoli, it is a pity that at this time of the year the cook uses frozen vegetables, on top of that they were overcooked summer and tasteless and the pancakes were also, unfortunately, frozen and extra soaked fry	-1	1
pancakes	the food was good, but very greasy. 3 stars for weak pancakes zero crunchiness from a lot of fat i know it's a fast food bar but you can try better. prices approx. 	-1	3
pancakes	terrible pancakes, without expression, only the jam saved them. drinks at horrendously high prices. stench. i strongly advise against	-1	1
pancakes	my first time  going to this restaurant and the customer service was great but the food was not good. we ordered typically breakfast food french toast and my daughter had pancakes. the french toast looked like fried chicken around the edges i‚Äôm not sure why. it didn‚Äôt taste good and was not warm. the sausage was also cold. the threw in a cup of cinnamon apples and raisin mix and that was also cold. my daughter pancakes were cold. i wouldn‚Äôt recommend for breakfast.	-1	1
pancakes	i do not recommend this place for families with young children. before we could order breakfast, our children were already very hungry, so we took out their milk bottles and banana pancakes that we had with us. after a while, the waitress came and informed us that we cannot eat our own food or drinks in the restaurant. despite explaining that it is food only for our children, she said that these are the rules and that it applies to children as well. my daughter is 18 months old and my friends' daughter is 2 years old. i've never been in a less child-friendly place.	0	1
pancakes	somehow not really. paid 45 euros for 4 (2 children and 2 adults). they took crayfish (not tasty, cooked in broth and there was little), there was no white beer, as ordered. there were only 3 potato pancakes. they brought chicken fillet to the children, they ate everything, but the potatoes - no, they were boiled, tasteless.	0	3
pancakes	very tasty food at fairly affordable prices. my wife and i dropped in with the intention of having breakfast and ended up with potato wedges. maybe the food should be a little warmer. the portions were quantified to the point in my opinion. we came very hungry and left full, without ordering pancakes which we also wanted. for 44 zlotys, you can eat two sets with a sandwich in the popular fast food or a normal meal in such a place. the choice is simple :)	0	5
pancakes	friendly welcome, good  selection of american cuisine.  nice location with  great view. food presented very nice, i highly recommend the nachos... are waiter chris aka fred was outstanding... well worth the visit... will be returning for pancakes...	0	3
pancakes	good and inexpensive food. more of a milk bar than a restaurant but tasty. i've been a few times, i've eaten myself but you can't count on culinary excitement. good compote, potato pancakes, etc. some dishes require seasoning. the pancakes could be baked on the fly, sometimes they are fried. nice garden and location on a side road. service a bit crazy. i don't know if tired or mannered every time but bearable. the toilet can be cleaned more often. overall i recommend it.	0	3
pancakes	we went for breakfasts (full english, beef bagel, pancakes). they were all delicious and well presented.	1	5
pancakes	this was our first visit, but certainly not the last. the potato pancake with smoked trout was absolutely masterful - i consider myself a master of potato pancakes and this one tasted as good as mine üòã the octopus for the main course was also perfectly cooked, and the celery ice cream for dessert surprised us with its unobvious taste. the restaurant also has a good wine list at a very good price. the service also met our expectations - the waitress was very nice, she appeared at the right moment and always found a moment to tell us something more about the dishes we eat (a huge plus for knowing the origin of each ingredient of the dish).	1	5
pancakes	friendly welcome, good  selection of american cuisine.  nice location with  great view. food presented very nice, i highly recommend the nachos... are waiter chris aka fred was outstanding... well worth the visit... will be returning for pancakes...	1	5
pancakes	food fresh and delicious. my wife and i ordered prawns for an appetizer and borscht. perfectly made shrimps and natural borscht, the way we make it for christmas. then the main course: tenderloin in chanterelle sauce on potato pancakes - a fairy tale! everything freshly made, golden pancakes, soft and juicy meat. the chefs are full of taste and craftsmanship. exemplary service. nice and smiling. we will come back. we recommend	1	5
pancakes	pancakes with cottage cheese and fruit - delicious, pork chop with potatoes and salad, great location, affordable prices.	1	5
ravioli	meh....  the fried mozzarella and gem salad were good.  my chicken parmesan was ok, wasnt a big fan of the added non-tomato based sauce, lemon zest, very acidic and over matched the chicken.   had to send back my wife's ravioli and broccolini because it was cold.  they did offer a comp dessert but since we had to wait on her dinner to be redone we weren't feeling dessert	-1	2
ravioli	i used to enjoy this place, but something has happened (i believe also the menu has changed and my favorites are gone). sourdough bread and wine was great, as it has always been - everything else was okay. bone marrow was not for our taste (but i guess people either love it or hate it). risotto was a bit too greasy/salty and not the right consistency for our taste, the ravioli was bland. the dinner just didn't feel like it met the $$$ spent for our group.	-1	2
ravioli	ordered some pastas and tiramisu. the ravioli was very lukewarm and watery. efficient service, but they never brought one of our drinks. decent portions and tiramisu. sadly i would not come here again, there is tastier italian in west loop (monteverde), river north (ciccio mio or torchio pasta bar), and lakeview (coda di volpe). friendly staff, unique interior, but mediocre food quality.	-1	2
ravioli	In Italy, simplicity and taste counts. Italian products alone are not enough, it still needs to be properly prepared. For an Italian restaurant, this rating is strongly -. Pizza tastes good (the only plus) but too moist (the artichoke gave up a lot of liquid). Bean soup with squid and clams, cold and unflavored, tasteless. Lasagne ok but warm and not hot (also underdone)! The son ordered ravioli with saffron sauce and another one with tomato sauce. The waiter didn't know where the wine he brought us was from. Generally, for a weak 4 dishes and a drink PLN 266 At this price, there should be a few grissini or olives on the table to wait for the meal (30-40 minutes), olive oil and Parmesan to sprinkle on the dishes and that 2 slices of bread to add the leftover sauce! No Italian experience and probably savings. It's a pity we don't want to learn! Instead of the Italian style, it is a bit lackluster	-1	1
ravioli	meat ravioli with tomato sauce was meh. a tad bland for my tastes. great ambience though and the wait staff provided excellent customer service	-1	3
ravioli	popped in for lunch and it wasn't a good decision for my wallet. i was interested in an off-the-menu dish, but i forgot to ask about the price and i paid 70 zlotys for a piece of meat and three ravioli. the course is correct, but not extraordinary. nice service.	0	3
ravioli	i expected better ravioli, and the dumplings did not surprise me with anything special. they were correct. both the dough itself and the stuffing. service nice but very slow.	0	3
ravioli	bread is the only dish that was good. ravioli average, coffee was horrible	0	3
ravioli	i have to say, based on the reviews i saw beforehand, my expectations were high and sadly they were not met when it came to the food. both of our mains (the ravioli and the steak ) were very average and underwhelming. not to mention the portion size was incredibly small for what we paid. i could get over that if the quality was above par, but i've seriously made store bought ravioli and pasta sauce that tasted better. however, the chocolate panna cotta was amazing as was the service from everyone at the restaurant. i would definitely go back, but just for dessert.	0	3
ravioli	the food was just okay. the service was disoriented. fish was overcooked and ravioli lackluster. grilled broccoli and steak tartar were the best part of the meal. maybe stick with the small plate appetizers if you go here and leave the main dishes. better yet, just go elsewhere.	0	3
ravioli	different impressions because the ravioli are delicious and the cod with chips was clearly frozen, dripping with fat and terribly over-salt, the waiting time for food was very long.	1	3
ravioli	very nice place and very nice staff. what i chose, i.e. focaccia with three pastes and ravioli, spinach and ricotta + white wine was very tasty. it was worth a visit :)	1	5
ravioli	delicious ravioli. nice idea for composing your own sets.	1	5
ravioli	very good pasta and ravioli only quite high prices üòå	1	5
ravioli	excellent place to taste the typical polish ravioli! very modern and bright environment, the ravioli are handmade in the kitchen.	1	5
bowl	bao buns are great, bowls with rice are great. but recently i had a chance to try a bowl with rice noodles in vietnamese sauce. very poor, raised to 3 stars for the previous dishes	-1	3
bowl	as hip as one can imagine, with obnoxiously loud music which makes shouting conversation rather unpleasant! their buns are quite ok, but keep away from bowls, if you are into real asian rice bowls, not soups!! the amount of ‚Äòbowl sauce‚Äô is just ridiculous, everything floats, or rather sinks like titanic under it	-1	2
bowl	the meat bowl is a mistake - very salty chicken, red cabbage so salty that it is almost inedible. generally, i would not call it a dish, but rather a jumble of different ingredients on a plate that do not necessarily create a harmonious whole	-1	2
bowl	noodle bowl is a joke, a mix of salads, a few slices of (good) beef, but nothing else, a sauce based on water and vinegar, which is not compatible with the rest of the salad, if i wanted to eat a salad, i would order a salad. i do not recommend and i do not know where all these 5-star reviews come from	-1	1
bowl	 really disgusting and not good food. the burritos, chicken and beef bowl were really not good. it didn't taste like mexican food at all. the worst mexican food i have eaten. i do not recommend	-1	1
bowl	 delicious shrimp bao rolls, and miso soup as well, while the sushi bowl is a slight misunderstanding that should not bear such a name, just a bowl of rice with lettuce and a few pieces of salmon, seasonal tea so sweet that you could not drink it	0	3
bowl	this place lacks a real mexican food, but the fact that you can eat for less than pln 30 - a grande burrito or all kinds of bowls is quite a decent portion of food	0	3
bowl	tasty, but i think that for the price there should be more additions, in practically every spaghetti i ordered here, but also in the photos posted by other users, you can see that there are definitely too few of them in relation to the size of the dish. at some point, you are left with half a bowl of sterile pasta. it's a pity as the restaurant seems to have potential	0	3
bowl	 a very delicious starter snack. pepper-mushroom soup is great and delicious, but a bit drenched in hundreds of pepper balls in one bowl	0	4
bowl	i have mixed feelings, the burrito is quite tasty although i miss cheese and the tortilla is terrible thin and rubbery like in a cheap kebab. burrito bowl okay, the meat was a little bit and that's what bothered me the most, the biggest problem was in the sauce (tomato) a lot of it everywhere and it only spoils the taste, my suggestion would be to add a cream-based sauce to the menu (i've already met one in mexican restaurants) then it would be fun and i could eat more often	0	2
bowl	 delicious bowls! it's nice that there are options for both carnivores and for those falafel eaters	1	4
bowl	interesting and tasty company dishes in bowls, unfortunately the mulled wine was cold. fast service.	1	4
bowl	we were passing through gda≈Ñsk, we were encouraged by the number of guests (even though we are not vegan). it quickly became clear where such crowds came from :) everything we ate was delicious and carefully prepared, we especially liked the bowl with kimchi. it is really worth visiting pestka while in the tri-city.	1	5
bowl	 very nice and professional service, (which does not always go hand in hand), only completed the sensational experience provided by the feast of bowl kimchi flavors. the multiplication of the palatal orgasm was provided by a poppy-seed dessert! so i express not only thanks, but also gratitude! <3	1	5
bowl	delicious kimchi bowl! i recommend.	1	5
beef	in my life i have never eaten seafood or beef worse. the ordered surf and turf turned out to be one big flop in terms of quality, taste and visual üò†	-1	1
beef	how many pad thai i have already eaten, it was a tragedy and literally a waste of money because it was not going to eat it. pasta overcooked, chicken dry and not even like chicken, and so is beef. one whistle is too much for this situation	-1	1
beef	 hotel oki unfortunately a visit to a restaurant and ordering roast beef was a mistake the dish was presented nicely, unfortunately it was impossible to eat it. first he was served cold and then he could not be chewed by gum. in a hotel with so many stars, i would expect higher quality.	-1	3
beef	delicious fish soup, beef brisket too intense in taste, as well as additives, so nothing fits together. wine prices from space, wine verde for 9 dollars? someone got hit	-1	3
beef	probably the worst tasting taco‚Äôs i‚Äôve ever had. completely bland and no flavor at all. pork, beef, shrimp, fish and chicken were alll horrible. margarita pitcher came so watered down, you could hardly taste anything else. definitely would not recommend this place to anyone.	-1	1
beef	good service. food was okay. pork chop overcooked. squid steak was nicely cooked, too many onions and looked like cuttlefish. steak tartare was okay, beef salad too sweet.	0	3
beef	asian noodles with beef - pln 42, falafel burger pln 29 and cola pln 9	0	3
beef	food - very tasty snacks fillo rolls and tzatziki, main course - beef kebap - ok, very salty skewers. very long waiting time for everything we ordered. the lady who served us poorly understood, tired from work. i do not know if we will be back again	0	3
beef	beef tartare ok, while boar bacon is average at most	0	3
beef	good food, average price, nice view and atmosphere. we ordered beef serloin steak.	0	5
beef	from everything ordered, only beef necks pleased. 	1	3
beef	we went for breakfasts (full english, beef bagel, pancakes). they were all delicious and well presented.	1	5
beef	something amazing! i did not expect such a feast for the taste buds. let me start with the service - the waiter is very friendly, smiling and helpful in choosing dishes and alcoholic beverages. the best tartare i have ever eaten with vodka. the young potato went like gold. beef cheeks melted in your mouth, great pork chop on the bone. a large selection of alcohols - i recommend trying the tinctures. when i am in gda≈Ñsk i will definitely come back here to try other dishes from the menu.	1	5
beef	the restaurant is very nice, good service and nothing can be faulted about the meals. delicious fish soup with cod, juicy ribs, delicious strawberries in a roast beef and chocolate fondant.	1	5
beef	love everything we ordered! first time to have beef cheeks, the meat was tasty tender and juicy!	1	5
seafood	the drama fish soup. cold. rubbery seafood ...	-1	1
seafood	bad, unfortunately. cold, salty, dragged ... seafood is not their cup of tea. if you want to drag the mussels and squids so that they become typical soles, you have to try really hard. the potato is totally burnt and the burning graviera cheese with fig salsa has nothing to do with the greek original. you wait a long time for your food (40 minutes), but there are no waits. in general, it could have been fun and it is traditional. the drama is complemented by intrusive pseudo-folk greek music from the 70s, which must probably remind guests where they are. unfortunately, combined with pseudo-greek dishes, it is equally indigestible.	-1	1
seafood	food was extremely salty. drinks were tasty but very weak. i ordered a seafood dish, super salty. i couldn't eat one bite. waitstaff blamed it on the new cooks. i wanted to enjoy this place but overly seasoned for is unacceptable.	-1	1
seafood	dish: tagliatelle with seafood, delivery. unfortunately, the spoiled expensive ingredients - the tentacle so coarsely marinated in the wine that its taste has been killed, the shells are half-broken, which makes the dish difficult to eat, the rest of the shells are of poor quality and cannot be opened	-1	2
seafood	thai seafood soup is a joke - only 2 shrimps 2 mussels for 34 zl.  i paid basically for a water	-1	2
seafood	service and cocktails was really good, but seafood plato was to far away from our expectations. not worth this money.	0	2
seafood	it was like we were in the twilight zone! not the anthony's we know. covid protocols have transformed this beloved waterfront seafood and chowder house into a sub-par fast-food (slow-food) joint. to say the service sucked, is an under statement! the only thing that has not changed are the prices	0	2
seafood	unfortunately, we had mixed impressions after the visit. the atmosphere itself and the service at a high level, while the food was very different. the amuse bouche and the starter are very good. however, the seafood platter we ordered for the main course turned out to be very average. tough octopus and dragged shrimp - not edible, everything else - colorless. on the plus side, the calamari saved the whole course.	0	3
seafood	there menu is limited. only seafood dishes.	0	3
seafood	their menu isn't very diverse. their kids menu was 90% seafood. our server was very friendly, but the food took a while to come out and it wasn't busy.	0	3
seafood	best seafood we have ever eaten !!! octopus, prawns and cozze just yummy !! we ate everything including lemon	1	5
seafood	the restaurant is located in a very nice, quiet place. nice service and delicious food! the seafood risotto and spaghetti bolognese were really good. delicious tart and great tiramisu !! we will definitely come here again	1	5
seafood	we were on the road on i95 north and asked siri for a five star seafood restaurant near and we end up to fire & wine.  as we entered, the host was super nice and welcomed us without reservations.  the food was delicious and service was excellent.  highly recommend	1	5
seafood	a great place with delicious, fresh seafood. both food and service - top! i heartily recommend and i will come back there for sure, because i haven't tried many of the dishes yet	1	5
seafood	nice service, atmospheric place, 1st class drinks and seafood delicious! i recommend a great place	1	5
falafel	there was nothing else in the falafel wrap, except dry lettuce, two slices of cucumber, and i found one red onion ring. and uninteresting falafels. i do not recommend.	-1	1
falafel	the worst falafel kebab i've had in my life. i don't know if the falafel was old, weathered, not thawed or what - at least it was inedible and i had to throw it away	-1	1
falafel	cold kebab, vegetarian kebs, no meat alternative, no salads, no falafel !!! and coming back both cold ... tragedy	-1	1
falafel	i agree 100% with mr. patryk. chips like chewing gum with lots of fat. the worst thing, however, is that there is no difference between a mixed sauce and a very hot sauce. the falafel kabab was uneatable with this sauce and went most of the trash. i was ordering for the first time and definitely the last.	-1	1
falafel	the falafel was dry, the beer glass was stinking with a dirty cloth. but the rest in the burger was tasty. and melon beer was fine as well	-1	3
falafel	a year ago, i gave it 5 stars but changed to 3. the last two orders in a row were very average. burgers with a bun so dry it's hard to swallow. we were ordering for 3 people and everyone had the same feeling. recently ordered drinking falafels and my favorite dish from this restaurant. in the middle, almost all beetroot, some soy sauce, falafels (quite tasty) but this dish is not fresh anymore, it is dry. i don't know if the cook has changed, but for now i'm taking a break from the non / meat one.	0	3
falafel	the kebabs are full of vegetables! however, the grilled vegetables were way too oily (which caused some stomach discomfort) and not that interesting (i only got carrots + potatoes). available vegetarian options: veg-only, or falafel. available in a pita, lavash, or plate/box.	0	2
falafel	when it was just opened, it was very good, staff were friendly, dishes are delicious. now it's dropping down standard. once avokado is partly rotten, the edge of green vegetables also became a bit rotten i have to cut them off before eating.  yesterday i got some falafel that's super spicy, they changed it, the new version was not grounded well at all, many pieces of whole chickpeas are inside, hard. i usually love falafel, this time it's really an exception.  the hot wine has too many gingers inside, on the photos you can see, all are gingers.	0	3
falafel	culinary experiences - fatal. the fries are fried, the sauces are very medium, the falafel falls apart and is not very tasty (but the best of all). prices very high for quantity and quality. the veg kebab box is all vegetables and should be called a salad	0	2
falafel	falafel plate quite ok, but the eggplant with te avivu terrible, eggplant in a very sweet sauce, could not be eaten. service not very interested in new guests - i do not recommend	0	3
falafel	falafel was good but the place did the beers neat and horrible customer service	1	2
falafel	delicious falafels and power bowls. and baklava is unearthly! in addition, very nice service!	1	5
falafel	the best falafels in the tri-city, good atmosphere, good people, every section of the card is full of surprises. a must-see at dolny!	1	5
falafel	delicious food, both meat and veg. i was surprised by the combination of cinnamon in a salty dish, which was an interesting discovery. very nice service. we also took 2 portions of falafels to go - exemplary. we brought them on the second day for lunch üëåüèª	1	5
falafel	only 3 stars because of that, but unfortunately we had to wait quite a long time for a meal over (25 minutes). during the pandemic, you can see that the restaurant spends a lot on take-out, but in my opinion the customer should not be lossy. the hummus that was supposed to be a starter was brought along with the main course. as for the food itself, the falafel and hamburger was very good.	1	3
ramen	"food from a lower average polka. ""ramen"" was tasteless (both decoction and vegetables) was nothing like the picture. no eggs, no peppers. some tasteless liquid and vegetables (mainly polish) cooked separately. there was nothing asian about it. chrispy spicy roll was ok although not spicy."	-1	1
ramen	unfortunately, the ramen was terrible, bittersweet, the nudle was one solid lump. as for sushi, even in supermarkets they can roll it up better, the whole set is packed in a small box, which made everything stick together and there was no option to take one piece out with chopsticks. by far the worst sushi in tri-city.	-1	1
ramen	a very frustrating gastronomic experience. went there  yesterday with a friend, the staff were very friendly, but the food was appalling. extremely greasy ramen soup which gave me food poisoning, and the worst tasting pad thai we‚Äôve ever had, sloppily presented with very few fresh ingredients. we‚Äôd have happily left without touching the food, but we‚Äôd waited for the order for at least 25 minutes, and were super hungry so we ate some. but wish we hadn‚Äôt.	-1	1
ramen	they should cut off the chef's hands for spaghetti in ramen !!! : p	-1	3
ramen	nice service, but the dishes are even worse. butter chicken is heavy and tastes worse than in other restaurants. the same goes for ramen.	-1	3
ramen	good beer, average ramen. the service is not charged to the bill is a good joke, it's a pity he's shy	0	2
ramen	correct, but the ramen-typical additions were missing in both ramen. high price, richness of flavors and a relatively small portion.	0	3
ramen	very average ramen, not to say weak, too hot, cold, poor additions for this price, i do not recommend it. the pub looks as if it was not even decorated by anyone, the service is unpleasant, they look at the customers badly, they unroll	0	2
ramen	unfortunately, the lady forgot about our order and we waited for about an hour in the place, where people who came in for us were already getting their orders and eating. to sum up‚Ä¶ ramen very average, fat with water, meat is a misunderstanding‚Ä¶. the wok noodles are delicious.	0	3
ramen	if someone is looking for good old ramen here - unfortunately, he will not find it here. ramen vol 2 is a misunderstanding. white fat-flavored broth, four thin slices of some fatty meat, egg and bamboo. very poorly. vege ramen is much more varied, but don't be fooled, it also doesn't taste great. sauerkraut and corn are quite an exotic insert. it gives 3 stars because the lemonade is good.	0	3
ramen	a great ultra-cozy vegan/vegetarian place with a small menu and perfect service. i loved both the curry, and the ramen. the food is very flavorful and beautiful to look at. the place is slightly off the beaten track, but definitely worth to wander from the old town for it exclusively. i'm a bit sad that the menu is so short - would love to try out more of their dishes!	1	5
ramen	ramen is great, want to try other dishes!	1	5
ramen	food revelation! burgers, waffles and ramen rock! very nice service.	1	5
ramen	great choice. very nice service. great ramen.	1	5
ramen	delicious vegan tartare and ramen. next time i will definitely taste the vegan duck breast.	1	5
bao	bao rolls with pulled pork - very weak: the meat is cold, the rolls are usually steamed cooked. tasty drinks, nice service, although each time someone else served. the decor of the place is nice. however, it is not very culinary and it does not encourage people to come back	-1	2
bao	we ordered a shrimp bowl and a set of bao scones. the food came cold, underdone, in fact, a dumpling tasteless. french fries have been forgotten. service: disaster. waiters play tag after the restaurant, while the waiters eat their meals behind the bar, there is no one person responsible for the table, each time a different waiter comes up. nobody asked if everything was okay while eating, nobody asked for something to drink when the glasses were empty. the waiters are busy chatting among themselves or eating at the bar, instead of cleaning up dirty tables or plates piled up by the rack of dishes. one big disaster. i think there is no manager there, the kitchen and the waiters do what they want. it's a pity because the location is great and the decor is beautiful. unfortunately, we will not go back there.	-1	1
bao	far away from a real bao‚Ä¶ disappointed	-1	2
bao	i ordered a set of bao, asking to make it without sauce and onion due to a health condition. we had to wait for the order for over half an hour and the bao were still served with sauce	-1	3
bao	when it comes to desserts, pingpong broke down a lot, once my favorite dessert was bao with ice cream, this time much worse, brilliant coconut ice cream replaced with mediocre vanilla ice cream. fruits with ice cream are terrible, only sugar and the price from outer space. management seems to be cutting costs and giving a lot of feedback. cool service.	-1	2
bao	i have been tempted for a long time to visit this place. i stopped by for lunch. i chose üëâ bao set #lunch set 2 x bao tofu / chicken / beef and fries / miso soup. optional. i had the bao tofu and chicken and miso soup.	0	1
bao	bao buns came out especially fast, most likely skipping corners, the beef looked old and was cold	0	1
bao	tempted by positive opinions, we went to the premises. unfortunately, the shrimp bao was very average - 3 shrimps + rolls with mayonnaise salad poured over another portion of mayonnaise - shrimps must be eaten separately because otherwise it is impossible to eat them, so they are rolled with mayonnaise, there were 3 mini leaves of coriander, the taste was imperceptible. the prawns are delicious on their own	0	3
bao	overall we were a bit disappointed with the food. great service, burger very weak, fish pesto ok, bao buns ... average. unfortunately we will not be back	0	3
bao	very nice place and it was decorated very nicely, it was quite empty when we got in. nice waitresses, food was ok. it was possible to eat. we praised the large portion of tea very much :) bao buns are tasty but they fell apart very much, prices too high.	0	3
bao	mixed fries crispy and delicious both, just like spring rolls. bao soft and delicious as well. affordable prices. i recommend it, i will definitely come back when i am in the area.	1	5
bao	this place is at a great location the staff here are very nice and friendly.i am vegan so you have  food for everyone.i had the tofu bao set and my wife had the mango curry.plus we ordered for drinks and sweet potato fries.all of it was very good.the place has good atmosphere and they are very quick with the food.overall i would highly recommend this place.	1	5
bao	delicious shrimp bao rolls, and miso soup as well, while the sushi bowl is a slight misunderstanding that should not bear such a name, just a bowl of rice with lettuce and a few pieces of salmon, seasonal tea so sweet that you could not drink it	1	5
bao	i am very surprised yesterday visiting woosabi. a beautiful, atmospheric place. we received our drinks about 3 minutes after ordering. i didn't have time to come back from the bathroom and the food was already on my table. bao is very light and tasty. very nice service. i definitely recommend :)	1	5
bao	constantly with family and friends, we choose this place to spend a good time. there is always room or a short wait. the team of employees is well-coordinated and that communication functions well among them. you don't wait long for food. quality of dishes and cocktails always great. the flavors of the dishes do not change over time, which is a big plus. the bao rolls tasted the same a year ago and now and if i want them, i can be sure that i will get what i expect. bao buns are, in my opinion, the best on the menu, especially those with prawns. the standard of the restaurant is always at a high level. order perfectly kept in every corner. i have never been disappointed. it is a place that is impossible to dislike. here i want to come back! üòÅ	1	5
burger	"compared to previous years, it is much worse. fewer employees (long waiting time for the waiter, drinks served almost at the same time as the food), poorer quality of ingredients (maybe only i came across such an ""ugly"" piece of chicken in a burger?) and definitely smaller portions (a burger much smaller, a dry roll ). prices much higher. i used to like going there very much. now, before i go there, i'll think twice."	-1	1
burger	unfortunately, it is not the same aioli as it used to be, after my last visit to which i invited my daughters on the occasion of the children's day, i was very disappointed, the hamburger i received, despite the abundant interior, was packed in a cold roll, which spoiled the whole taste, and the apogee was serving coffee iced with whipped cream, which was fermented, sour and even sparkling.	-1	1
burger	really really really bad personel, bad atmosphere, very looooong time of waiting for everything, cold inside and the worst thing is that burger was expensive and also really bad - long story short everything here was bad and i don't recommend at all.	-1	1
burger	we ordered a burger, the meat stank and the taste was broken. the waitress went to consult the cook on this fact, who stated that the meat had arrived fresh this morning. despite our dissatisfaction and not being able to eat the meal because of the terrible taste, there was no reaction from the restaurant. i do not recommend!	-1	1
burger	unfortunately the burgers are not as good as they look. you can eat tastier at this price.	-1	1
burger	it's hard for me to comment .. we went to this restaurant for many years .. we held family parties and communion. unfortunately, for the last few months the menu has been limited to items like .. um .. i would say bar-style .. burgers appeared, for example. the steaks are gone .. the fish .. today we just left the restaurant after a few minutes of studying the menu. we ate dinner elsewhere. but we came back for dessert in the form of ice cream .. actually .. everything would be ok .. if not for the bill .. the menu shows an ice cream dessert in the amount of pln 12. however, there was 18 pln on the bill. the nice waitress said that there was some error in the system. i hope the restaurant will return to its former shape. the ice cream from what i remember comes from the confectionery in nowy port and it was very good. but today hm .. i can't give more than 3 stars.	0	3
burger	unfortunately the place has deteriorated. the new menu is not great. the burger is now with a sweet big bun, the filling itself is not enough. the french fries were brought to me old and cold. the coffee is sour (!). a friend's steak was fine, but the baked potato was tasteless to him. waited for the bill for a long time.	0	3
burger	i have always appreciated aioli, a very nice place with a kitchen that suits my taste, but after the last visit i was a bit disappointed when it comes to prices ... basic burger 37 zlotys, caesar salad with chicken 42 zlotys, freshly squeezed juice ... diluted with water, pilsner beer 17 zlotys. as long as the price of the burger can be forgiven, because it was tasty and with additives, the price of the salad is a cosmos, a few leaves of lettuce and not all 100g of chicken for pln 42.	0	3
burger	 we were yesterday and we ordered 3 burgers which were average :( the sauce for the fries was delicious and the fries :) and as for burgers, there is a lot going on on the plate, but on average everything fits together e.g. in surf and turf	0	2
burger	burger - average, mostly cold, other dishes have defended themselves. the service makes up for it with courtesy, but when serving 1/4 of the espresso lands on the saucer, without thinking, i give myself a new one and do not look at whether the customer will react or not.	0	3
burger	update: throughout our stay in the tri-city, we were three times. we rate the food 6 * each time! on the first day, we searched the entire old town for a long time. everything on the menu is the same - supreme chicken, burgers and steaks‚Ä¶. here is the original menu. the taste is amazing - you can see that they cook real, use spices, not instant gunpowder. we really recommend it !! and the portions - judge for yourself üòç see you next year ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©	1	5
burger	very good messi burger, smaller than picture though, good service, next time nornal burger	1	5
burger	i came with my friends for a burger, they all had time to eat and i waited and waited (35 minutes). the burger itself is great	1	3
burger	great place that advertises itself. for music lovers, the dress and gadgets will be an additional pleasant surprise. we went for starters, burgers and pifka, which is great for me. as they say, it was cheap, but it's worth a try, i highly recommend a feast for body and soul üòÅ	1	5
burger	very good bbq burger and snacks. outstanding service. big portions, but quite expensive. some dishes are so large, e.g. chicken noodles, that two women can easily order half of them for themselves, because they will not eat the whole meal. there are fries with the burger and the whole burger with fries is a really huge portion. i recommend	1	5
dessert	once my favorite restaurant in gda≈Ñsk. now i warn everyone about visiting this place, although the service is trying hard and that's the only plus, the food is terrible. pear and parsley soup was inedible, desserts that were once insane at this point are a failure. the waiter informed us that the chef had changed and that was probably the worst decision the owners could have made	-1	1
dessert	i definitely do not recommend it if you want to spend pleasant moments with something tasty. someone who cooks there doesn't like people. nice service, but it doesn't fix the lack of taste. i started getting beaten wife syndrome and i tasted more dishes. i can only recommend the prawns - they were tasty, the worst was the ribs covered in the worst bbq sauce. desserts 2/5 drenched in juicy chocolate sauce and whipped cream - welcome to the 90s	-1	1
dessert	"never lose your way there. the worst ""restaurant"" i have ever come across. awful dishes, no decent desserts and salty prices. forget it"	-1	1
dessert	riverside dym i ogie≈Ñ = really disappointed > desserts not worth eatingüòû > but to be fair the place and personal was cosy and kind.	-1	2
dessert	my mother and i went to the restaurant to taste coffee and dessert, we didn't try the dishes. the assessment concerns the ordered cakes, coffees, service and general atmosphere	-1	1
dessert	it's hard for me to comment .. we went to this restaurant for many years .. we held family parties and communion. unfortunately, for the last few months the menu has been limited to items like .. um .. i would say bar-style .. burgers appeared, for example. the steaks are gone .. the fish .. today we just left the restaurant after a few minutes of studying the menu. we ate dinner elsewhere. but we came back for dessert in the form of ice cream .. actually .. everything would be ok .. if not for the bill .. the menu shows an ice cream dessert in the amount of pln 12. however, there was 18 pln on the bill. the nice waitress said that there was some error in the system. i hope the restaurant will return to its former shape. the ice cream from what i remember comes from the confectionery in nowy port and it was very good. but today hm .. i can't give more than 3 stars.	0	3
dessert	worst experience. they served me a lychee martini that had no lychee in it. i ordered the cauliflower and i had to eat it with sushi sticks because they never brought me silverware. i ordered the baby ribs, the sauces they bring are too spicy and the waitress did not say them. without the sauce the ribs are anything, then with my hands full of sauce for the ribs it lasted half an hour that they came to attend to me to order dessert (the only good thing about the place) they never gave me napkins. to ask for the bill i had to wait at least 20 minutes. i would never go back and i do not recommend it at all	0	1
dessert	tasty dessert, but inadequate in terms of size compared to the price. i would go to amaro for a moment. the service is moderately polite, probably due to the small order. such customers are seen to be unwelcome at this restaurant. i am also shocked by the fact of self-charging a tip, which they definitely did not deserve.	0	3
dessert	i'd give a 4 as there is a very small selection of desserts and veggies but the prices are affordable and the service is always nice so a 5 is ok. good location. you can eat something tasty inexpensively. shrimp noodles - a revelation. cheesecake and apple pie - no crazy	0	5
dessert	most of the dishes were reheated, underdone and firm. nice but poorly organized service. plus a free dessert in compensation	0	3
dessert	an interesting selection of dishes prepared in a very exquisite way. however, the portions are very modest, even tasting (although the price does not suggest it). it makes sense if someone wants to enjoy a starter, main course and dessert (all at a high level), otherwise there is a lot of hunger (the photo shows the main course - squid schnitzel). the menu lacks soft drinks and beer (but everything is available) - very friendly service helps here.	1	3
dessert	brilliant food, from soup to dessert, all delicious. children's dishes mild in taste, a large selection on the menu. a place definitely for families with small children, there is a separate playroom with monitoring, a separate toilet for children. stroke! we will definitely be back	1	5
dessert	great decor of the place and great atmosphere thanks to music and music videos. i had the pleasure of tasting only the desserts because we came to the place to drink coffee and eat something sweet, but both the cake and the way of serving and the portion size at the highest level. a rich menu card and during the next visit i will definitely try something from the main menu. i highly recommend it to fans of rock music, but also to everyone else because i have never eaten a better dessert, and the other dishes also smelled and looked delicious.	1	5
dessert	amazing food, both drinks and desserts. it's been a long time since i met the staff who cared so much for the client from entry to exit after the time spent.	1	5
dessert	a very nice place. live music. courteous service. i ordered a steak. it was over-baked, it was replaced with a fresh one, just the way i wanted it. the waiter offered dessert as an apology. a very large dessert! :). delicious drinks.	1	5
sushi	tasteless sushi, the rolls were falling apart	-1	1
sushi	tasteless chicken ramen, disappointing sushi.	-1	2
sushi	i am very disappointed, i ordered sushi for delivery, the quality of the products is not the best or fresh, the tempura shrimp rolls were soaked, all the rolls were falling off dry reams and i had the impression that it was sour. i do not recommend it, the worst sushi i have ever eaten ...	-1	1
sushi	"inept imitation of a ""sushi restaurant"""	-1	1
sushi	unfortunately, the ramen was terrible, bittersweet, the nudle was one solid lump. as for sushi, even in supermarkets they can roll it up better, the whole set is packed in a small box, which made everything stick together and there was no option to take one piece out with chopsticks. by far the worst sushi in tri-city.	-1	1
sushi	delicious shrimp bao rolls, and miso soup as well, while the sushi bowl is a slight misunderstanding that should not bear such a name, just a bowl of rice with lettuce and a few pieces of salmon, seasonal tea so sweet that you could not drink it	0	3
sushi	i ordered several different sushi sets from mami sushi. the ingredients were fresh, however everything tasted similar. no panache. i have already ordered sushi restaurants in the tri-city and i rate the sets from mami sushi as average. nice service, but forgot to add soy sauce to the takeout order, even though i asked for it to be added. in general, i have no major reservations, but i will not order more there.	0	3
sushi	very little space to sit and talk freely over sushi ... a take-and-leave-style restaurant ... the food is average ... neither particularly exquisite nor in my mouth ... is it worth visiting? .. yes ... well at least to form your own opinion ...	0	3
sushi	worst experience. they served me a lychee martini that had no lychee in it. i ordered the cauliflower and i had to eat it with sushi sticks because they never brought me silverware. i ordered the baby ribs, the sauces they bring are too spicy and the waitress did not say them. without the sauce the ribs are anything, then with my hands full of sauce for the ribs it lasted half an hour that they came to attend to me to order dessert (the only good thing about the place) they never gave me napkins. to ask for the bill i had to wait at least 20 minutes. i would never go back and i do not recommend it at all	0	1
sushi	still in progress, but gordon has made his way to cherokee. there's currently a bakery/cafe, a pizza place and a burger place serving beef, chicken and impossible burgers with plain, truffle or sweet potato fries. looks like a sushi place and some other spots will be added soon.	0	5
sushi	sushi very good, great prices. the service was terrible. the ladies gave the impression that they were working for punishment.	1	3
sushi	delicious bao buns with different fillings, variety of bowls, and curry - a broad choice of tasty oriental dishes to treat yourself with. you can also have a combo option for bao - 2 or 3 buns with miso or fries (classic or sweet potato). my favorite is bao with tofu and bao with shrimps, my spouse loves pork so kimchi. honestly, whichever you choose will taste great. another dish i love is sushi bowl - rice with fresh salmon, avocado, and salad. as for the drinks, there are plenty of cocktails and other drinks to choose from.	1	5
sushi	good price, good sushi. well, i will not buy again because of the service. most people don't buy sushi every day and can't know everything. for me, laughing in the face of the client is not acceptable.	1	3
sushi	wish i golfed here too but the sushi rolls at roys were top 3 all time. amazing	1	5
sushi	stunningly beautiful. have appetizers on the patio, enjoy the view. roy's serves delicious sushi rolls. try the spanish bay bloody mary - really good.	1	5
scrambled eggs	breakfast, waiting time, hour. fried eggs, unfortunately, the protein did not have enough time to cut the soy :) scrambled eggs half burnt, half not cut :( tea and coffee ok.	-1	1
scrambled eggs	i have been here two times as a tourist and first time the ribs was dry (this was in march), second was today to eat breakfast. the scrambled eggs was overcooked and it seemes the chef must have been in a rush. but it is not why i give it one star. the service is terrible.	-1	1
scrambled eggs	i'm sorry, but unfortunately the breakfast is very bad, we ordered scrambled eggs and asked for it to be more cut and we got completely liquid scrambled eggs. the lady asked if everything tasted good, we said that unfortunately not because the scrambled eggs were not cut at all, the lady said that she gave the cook as much as the answer we received. we had to pay the whole price, although we did not like it at all. well, we won't be back again.	-1	1
scrambled eggs	i was at breakfast today and i don't know what happened to this place. it used to be delicious at an attractive price, now, unfortunately, when i ordered shakshouka, i got tomato soup with raw eggs cut only from above. in addition, three slices of plain bread, certainly not home-made. for a place called marmolada, bread and coffee is shockingly inadequate. i reported it to the waiter and asked for scrambled eggs, which were served to me right on the table in a tiny ikea frying pan for children, no plate, no vegetables. in addition, the waiter laughed a lot unnecessarily and was aggressive, where i clearly did not want to get into a discussion. you also joked about my lactose intolerance, asking if i should also give my tea without lactose? i don't know where the joke was. he also joked that he does not know if the coffee is lactose free as i ordered ?? the prices are currently inadequate,	-1	1
scrambled eggs	i haven't eaten such disgusting sausages and uncooked scrambled eggs for a long time ...	-1	1
scrambled eggs	good breakfasts, friendly service, nice location, lovely fresh-squeezed juices! the only thing that did not suit me was the scrambled eggs that were too dry to a chip.	0	3
scrambled eggs	together with the girl we are a bit disappointed. we ordered scrambled eggs with bacon and tomatoes, unfortunately we got scrambled eggs and bacon separately, tomatoes were a separate mini arugula salad. this is not what we expected. breakfast bread is heat-sealed slices of wholemeal bread that broke the teeth. the waitress acted as if she had finished a well-fed party an hour earlier. we will not be back.	0	3
scrambled eggs	i just had a simple breakfast: scrambled eggs with bread + butter. the eggs were good (but it‚Äôs not a rocket science). the bread, however, was way below average - just like some cheap toast bread from a supermarket. could be toasted at least...	0	3
scrambled eggs	the breakfast was just good (scrambled eggs and sausages), nothing special. the bread could be better (maybe toasted?)	0	4
scrambled eggs	very traditional menu. good bread, very few vegetables. for scrambled eggs i got 3 slices of tomato and one cucumber. price inadequate to what is on the plate. if you fancy a breakfast such as scrambled eggs, frock coat, cottage cheese, that's ok. but if you want to eat something interesting, something other than the daily home menu, i advise against it.	0	3
scrambled eggs	delicious scrambled eggs with bacon and chives to which they give fresh, crispy bread. for this delicious coffee which, in combination with breakfast, gives energy for half a day;) in a word, recommended	1	5
scrambled eggs	delicious breakfasts, scrambled eggs, omelettes, pancakes, toasts, the choice is wide and everyone will like something	1	5
scrambled eggs	breakfast very good. eggs benedict or scrambled eggs delicious fresh ... bread would change only to a thin toasted egg and in scrambled eggs should also be bagels, rolls or bread without gluten to choose. i missed the british breakfast, bagels with various toppings. typical breakfast coffee, i prefer strong, clear ...	1	3
scrambled eggs	went here because it was one of the very few places open before 9 or 10am. very good breakfast buffet. the scrambled eggs were really good and i enjoyed the gnocchi :)	1	5
scrambled eggs	lovely staff, we were served by ms. kasia. well spoken and friendly.brilliant food. we had the scrambled eggs, waffle sandwich, eggs benedict and shashuka ( a little tangy for me) but good flavour. a very nice breakfast place.	1	5
soup	horrible dry pizza, i do not recommend it. the sour rye soup was supposed to be in bread but it wasn't, unacceptable, i won't even take it out, really terrible. they should come here !!!!!	-1	1
soup	very high prices, inadequate for quality. beetroot soup made of cardboard, taste at least strange. dishes that are not very tasty, the restaurant should focus on freshness of the products. we will not return there.	-1	2
soup	good pasta. fish soup very weak and tiny, and it cost pln 25: /	-1	3
soup	chili con carne very good, i recommend. weak broth. we haven't eaten such a bad soup for a long time :) literally diluted broth with a small amount of pasta, tasteless.	-1	3
soup	they force me the soup by force, the beetle in the soup	-1	1
soup	very average food, served cold as well. meat dumplings - very dry inside. tomato cream soup - mixed soup, no revelation. most importantly - a vulgar cook who insults customers with the thought that no one in the room hears. the only positive is the decor and nice waiters. i do not recommend	0	1
soup	a very atmospheric place, unfortunately we got the sour rye soup in summer and when it comes to taste it is very average. the service was polite.	0	4
soup	food very well presented, unfortunately wild boar ribs, sour rye soup and fondant very average, meringue on the other hand delicious. a big minus for completely disregarding the comment about a piece of string in the ribs.	0	3
soup	we ordered onion soup and sour rye soup.	0	1
soup	unfortunately, the sour rye soup does not impress.	0	4
soup	very tasty soup, pizza a little bit plump but it's cool :)) friendly service	1	5
soup	tasty food, delicious sour rye soup, very good cod. professional service, everything delivered quickly. unfortunately, the prices compared to the food served were excessive. the 110 pln steak was tasteless as was the sauce. instead, it was fried as desired. i believe that at such prices the restaurant cannot receive 5 stars.	1	3
soup	very nice restaurant great decor, there is a kids' corner and food cossack tomato cream 10/10 will be eaten many times recommend prices git onion soup also extra and mushroom tagiatelle wonderful such a creamy mmhmm people go there	1	5
soup	i have never eaten such a good fish! it felt fresh, melted nicely in the mouth and had a nice buttery aftertaste. fish soup also very tasty, well seasoned. as you can see, large portions. the place was full, but still, we didn't wait long for the dishes. nice and helpful staff. i highly recommend!	1	5
soup	for the first time in a long time, i have met with everything that was ordered was delicious. the tomato cream soup i think was the best i have ever eaten, the pasta with prawns was also very delicious (very delicate prawns) we also ordered other dishes which were also mega. i recommend 10/10	1	5
hummus	food generally good, but we ordered hummus with vegetables which is terribly sour, the vegetables were underdone and generally nothing interesting, the asparagus is very tough, i guess underdone. we hope it will be better next time.	-1	3
hummus	 as for me, breakfasts are not worth recommending. orange juice was ordered (it didn't even taste like an orange) -too much water in it; ((hummus also tasteless; (((. they keep bread in dirty baskets: (((not recommended	-1	2
hummus	lamb with hummus not good. beer is bad as well. overpriced place.	-1	2
hummus	 friendly service, food generally very good, except for the usual hummus, which is served with some main courses - very watery texture, poorly seasoned, it rarely happens that something really does not taste good to me and that was unfortunately such a situation :( i don't know if it was because of the consistency of the dish, or maybe for other reasons, i felt sick for a few hours after the meal	-1	2
hummus	 food generally good, but we ordered hummus with vegetables which is terribly sour, the vegetables were underdone and generally nothing interesting, the asparagus is very tough, i guess underdone. we hope it will be better next time	-1	3
hummus	"unfortunately, i rate the food as very average. a very tiny set of mezze, a micro portion of hummus, a handful of pickles, and some sauce. the hummus itself was slightly bland, tahini hardly felt, there was no feeling of lemon. in addition, we took a pot of classic lemonade (i am sure it was ""fortified"" with some artificial lemon juice for dilution, it was definitely not just lemon with mint. too large chunks other ingredients, this dish was bland kofta burgers okay, but they lacked ‚Äúthat something.‚Äù on the plus side of the soup of the day gazpacho given the high rating and lots of positive comments, we expected something much better."	0	3
hummus	"the beautiful view bumps this up to a three star review, but other than that, we won't  be coming back. the staff is absolutely kind and extremely personable. the menu had zero vegan options- other than a large dollop of hummus and 2 stalks of celery and carrots... to top that exciting menu off, several children were running around like it was a playground. not sure what kind of ""fancy"" or *upscale*  establishment this is but where we are from this sort of thing wouldn't have happened.. also, ""resort attire"" must mean that women can dress like they're about to go to yoga."	0	3
hummus	in fact, everything is ok, but nothing is amazing except the prices. hummus with vegetables for pln 25 is basically hummus with a symbolic vegetable decoration. i understand that the rent is probably high, but i prefer to go for a walk there and eat better. for example in falla in the snowdrift.	0	3
hummus	only 3 stars because of that, but unfortunately we had to wait quite a long time for a meal over (25 minutes). during the pandemic, you can see that the restaurant spends a lot on take-out, but in my opinion the customer should not be lossy. the hummus that was supposed to be a starter was brought along with the main course. as for the food itself, the falafel and hamburger was very good.	0	3
hummus	modern place with a fairly reduced menu but quality products. we tried the cheese board, very well presented and variety. the eggplant hummus however was small and the presentation could be improved. the excellent and close treatment and the relaxed atmosphere	0	3
hummus	hummus rocks. the other dishes are also very tasty. quite a large selection of desserts. i recommend :)	1	5
hummus	muze, hummus and kofta very tasty, well presented, very friendly service. we will probably come back here to test other items :) i think the food is on a similar level to the non / meat one, but here it is much more expensive	1	4
hummus	imaginative and very tasty breakfasts, served in a cozy place. recommendable hummus, shakshuka and both types of breakfast - meat and vegetarian. very nice service :)	1	5
hummus	excellent veg food, taste, composition. nice decor, quite intimate. great hummus! i recommend :)	1	5
hummus	always delicious! wonderful power bowls, hummuses, brownies ... :) i recommend it to everyone!	1	5
spaghetti	way overpriced. i tried the black spaghetti, gnocci, steak. all of which were bland, and didnt even have meats (other than the steak dish obviously, and the menu didnt even mention this) so the dishes just felt empty. kinda feel scammed tbh.	-1	1
spaghetti	so disappointed. as a seattle native, i‚Äôm a big fan of ethan stowell, but this was the worst experience today. my family and i went for restaurant week and were seated outside in the blistering cold. they insured us it would be warm enough although they had no blankets. as we put our order in we were notified that they were out of several things on the menu one of which i wanted to get so i pivoted i‚Äôve got something else within a few minutes it started hailing following by heavy rain. we were frozen and wet and our food had not even come out yet. we were not offered a cup of tea or cup of coffee to keep warm. are food finally arrived in my father-in-law who had gotten the salmon had a fairly over cooked fish, i had gotten the scallop dish with three of the smallest scallops i have ever seen, my mother-in-law had the risotto which was very watery, and my husband had the pork and spaghetti dish which was very bland. when we went to order our dessert we were notified that one of the two options they were out of so we were only left with the panna cotta. for someone with a dairy allergy this was really disappointing as no other alternatives were provided. we were also told that they did not make their desserts on location but rather get it delivered daily from another kitchen . for $50 a person we felt genuinely ripped off at the quality, presentation, delivery, and taste of our food. not to mention that it was absolutely freezing and we were miserable. the restaurant did not really do much to comfort or accommodate the guests who are outside, offering a cup of tea  or an additional something would‚Äôve really made the difference.	-1	2
spaghetti	i ordered spaghetti bolognese - price inadequate to what i got: almost only pasta, traces of meat - definitely not recommended!	-1	2
spaghetti	"unfortunately, i do not recommend it. chops in classic burgers burnt and quite hard. i don't know what is on the menu ""red onion jam"" because we just got chopped, raw onion (but the color was right :)). spaghetti with meatballs - ""sauce"" looked like someone just poured canned tomatoes over the pasta, the whole thing looked unappetizing. inedible-raw fries. unprofessional service, although one lady was nice. the second one looked slightly offended. maybe we hit a bad day, but we will not check it :) one star for the location, the rest veeery poorly."	-1	1
spaghetti	when asked to give me the tastiest dish they have, i got something that resembled spaghetti, but the taste was extremely disgusting. i forced myself to eat it only because i paid pln 40 for it, so it was a pity to throw it away and it was my only meal after a whole day of work without eating. never again.	-1	1
spaghetti	beef cheeks were well cooked, fried spaghetti is not to my taste.	0	3
spaghetti	the pasta was great, and three stars for the fact that i ordered spaghetti and i got tagliatelle like nothing, and it spoiled the whole effect	0	3
spaghetti	nice ambiance! i took my friend here for a shared plate of anchovy spaghetti. the hostess was not at all friendly or accommodating and treated my vietnamese friend as if she couldn't understand english when she asked about an empty inside table. the waiter, on the other hand, was quite congenial and pleasant and responsive. the spaghetti was thick and pasty and, although i expected a bit of salt from the anchovies, this w-a-y over the top. the waiter offered to bring us another plate but we had had our fill.	0	3
spaghetti	my daughter really liked the ravioli,  but the rest of us weren't that impressed with the spaghetti,  fettuccine, or mostaccoili  it was fine italian food, but it wasn't anything we hadn't had before or made at home.	0	3
spaghetti	spaghetti with prawns in tomato sauce, sweet, not salty and not at all expressive. and pea shoots? small portion. prices quite high	0	3
spaghetti	very good shrimp spaghetti	1	5
spaghetti	it's nice to eat delicious warm food after a cold walk. the spaghetti tagliatelle with truffles and the caesar salad turned out to be delicious. i highly recommend this place. we will definitely come back here. thank you. :-)	1	5
spaghetti	spaghetti with sirloin and molto delicioso porcini mushrooms	1	5
spaghetti	super tasty, and good spaghetti bolognese for the son	1	5
spaghetti	love this little gem. onion soup was lovely but a little bit too salty. the seafood spaghetti was brilliant. reasonable price..4-5 selection of wine (both white and red).	1	4
dumplings	nice service, unfortunately these are some of the worst pierogi i've had, and i'm not picky. small dumplings, but the price for this number of pieces is also not great, so i have nothing to do with it. unfortunately, some are really weak in taste	-1	2
dumplings	the cream soup was quite good, while the russian dumplings tasted like water with dough and were overcooked and served only with cream. i exchanged dumplings for a salad, serving chicken in this salad is just a joke, just like the ordered aperol, which we didn't get. i do not recommend this restaurant and will never return to it for sure.	-1	1
dumplings	dumplings cold and dry, pasta cold and dry, brussels sprouts - lukewarm and overcooked, beans - cold and with a strange bitter aftertaste, ribs probably spoiled and of course - cold. prices - like out of space compared to quality. traumatic experiences. we don't recommend it, we had to go to mac after spending 90 zlotys on bad food.	-1	1
dumplings	 the service was very nice, we were told about all the dishes with pleasure. food lumpy, potato pancakes very good, dumplings sticking together badly, so there was a lot of water inside. large and very good hutsuls deruny, but veggie poltawan jelly without any flavor	-1	3
dumplings	 very average food, served cold as well. meat dumplings - very dry inside. tomato cream soup - mixed soup, no revelation. most importantly - a vulgar cook who insults customers with the thought that no one in the room hears. the only positive is the decor and nice waiters. i do not recommend	-1	1
dumplings	 nice service, but mixed feelings about food. duck dumplings 3+ because they were cold.	0	2
dumplings	pretty tasty dumplings. unfortunately, the waiting time from the declared 15 minutes was 35. wonton soup inedible - such water after dumplings with 3 tablespoons of salt. i asked for an exchange, for example, for kimchi, but it required the consent of the owner - i gave up.	0	2
dumplings	only 3 stars, i ate there incl. tripe and potato dumplings - both dishes were unfortunately average	0	3
dumplings	i ate dumplings and pielmieni: delicious stuffing, but the doughs were thick and hard. so very average.	0	3
dumplings	i am forced to change my opinion, after the last visit i was surprised by a different menu, the fact is that i haven't been there for a long time, but i remember the fried dumplings well. currently, there are no fried dumplings on the menu. there is also no selection of portions. the dumplings themselves tasty, but earlier it was better. also on the disadvantage is the change of the brewery, there is no more beer from the amber brewery	0	3
dumplings	 delicious food. the gypsy pancake is a revelation, the goulash with potato dumplings is also very tasty. nice service.	1	3
dumplings	delicious dumplings, it's a pity there is so little space inside.	1	3
dumplings	the order arrived on time, the dumplings were delicious as usual, but i was not allowed to enjoy the full portion as it came mixed with a different type of dumplings.	1	3
dumplings	very tasty dumplings, nice place, short waiting time, but a big minus for not informing about additional paid extras. mrs. waitress offers, for example, cream, salads with dumplings - without informing that they are payable	1	3
dumplings	the service is very, very nice. delicious dumplings, worth recommending (we ordered 3 types), but i strongly advise against the sour rye soup: very salty, too thick, with overcooked potatoes inside. it's a pity as this dish influenced the rating.	1	3
coffee	bartending service at a very low level. nasty barmaid, sloppy coffee.	-1	1
coffee	hard roll until it crunches. i do not recommend coffee. sour until it twists. pln 100 thrown down the drain. only the toast was tasty	-1	1
coffee	hopeless coffee.	-1	1
coffee	"bad breakfast on big price. who can eat such ""english breakfast""? like in russia 40 years ago. bad coffee. there are many better places to eat at a lower price in gda≈Ñsk"	-1	2
coffee	nice place, very interesting decor, but unfortunately the coffee is bad.	-1	3
coffee	coffee ok .. i have reservations about the amount of coffee in the mug ... not an adiculous amount for the price!	0	1
coffee	their service was good, and the coffee and  food was like okay but the portion was very  small. we ordered coffee which was with cheaper price when ordered with breakfast but the staff didn't state that my choice of latte wasn't included in the deal, so we ended up with a bill with 20 z≈Ç more. this was not a big issue for me but i could have been told about it when i made my order. for me this price was not worth it	0	2
coffee	the service is good! but the range of food is quite small. for example only pour over coffee. great place for veggie/vegan folks but as someone who eats meat i felt favour was missing (i normally enjoy vegan food). lovely pear tea though! would pop in for dessert and tea.	0	3

coffee	terrible service, i have been twice and each time they showed that when there are a lot of people to serve them, their kindness falls to the customers. in addition, they talk terribly to each other, the waiters work in a very unpleasant atmosphere. however, the coffee is delicious. oh and the bartenders were very nice so make up for the bad behavior of the waiters.	1	1
coffee	as for a bistro in this location, the dishes are not the cheapest. they are not bad, but they do not make a special impression either. pork chop looks large, but so thin that the meat is almost imperceptible and muffled with a thick coating. chicken noodles are a slightly better option. but the coffee is good. the atmosphere inside is quite nice	1	3
coffee	coffee and matcha very good, we liked the cake too, although we are not very fond of vegan ones. mega admiration for such beautiful pastries, you can eat with your eyes :) inside, the decor is also very cozy. the only thing, but i have to serve behind the bar: there is little traffic in the place for saturday, and no response to greeting and accepting the order as a punishment, with a martyr's face and casual answers to questions. unfortunately, the impression is broken, i felt like an unwanted guest, it's a pity.	1	3
coffee	warm climate, family atmosphere. the food is tasty, so is the coffee	1	4
coffee	place at the very center of gda≈Ñsk. nice service and acceptable waiting time. very lady decor. prices a bit overpriced (location charms). the meals presented in a nice way look great on the plate, but there was no wow effect during the meal. food okay though i have had better breakfasts. delicious coffee	1	4
