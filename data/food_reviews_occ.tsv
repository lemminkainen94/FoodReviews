omelette	we ordered two omelettes and two lemonades.	0	1
omelette	delicious breakfasts, scrambled eggs, omelettes, pancakes, toasts, the choice is wide and everyone will like something	1	5
omelette	we took a baguette and an omelette with paprika, all seasoned well.. a great selection of mini salad dressing, served with an omelette.	1	5
omelette	always a good spot for some delightful breakfast, despite the fact at the time of my visit they were out of potatoes they still made a great omelette and toast!	1	5
omelette	my omelette and grits were better than expected.	1	4
omelette	the cheesecakes were quite good and the omelette very tasty.	1	2
omelette	sorry but i don't want french fries with my omelette.	0	3
omelette	"after half an hour we ask where our order is, the waitress that it will be in 10 minutes, then after 15 minutes we ask again and that they are ""already putting on"" ... frustrated after another 5 minutes we get up and say that we are leaving, the waitress brings food suddenly (already not the one who served us originally, the other one has already started avoiding us), only an omelette was served, the second course was served after another 5 minutes ... we ate quickly and paid equally quickly and left."	0	1
omelette	food was cooked well,but,i could not pronounce the omelette dish i ordered.. ordinary american or western omelettes were not available.	-1	3
omelette	we didn't eat the omelette to the end and we ended up visiting ... it's a pity but i won't use it anymore	-1	1
omelette	when the order finally came (omelette with soinach) it was just watery with low quality, cheapest tesco bread you can imagine.	-1	2
omelette	failure ... a long waiting period, 45 minutes for breakfast (fried eggs and an omelette is a bit of a lot) plus winter coffee, because the waitress forgot to bring ... dinner supposedly ok, but portions are small compared to the price and vegetables are undercooked, the service is messy and not very nice, i do not recommend it	-1	2
omelette	Nice service, however, my omelette was a little bit dry.	0	4
omelette	Slightly dry toast, omelette could be better seasoned.	0	5

pizza	we ordered two pizzas.	-1	3
pizza	very pleasant atmosphere, great location, but the taste of the pizza is very average, and a punctuation error on the card encouraging you to leave your opinion.	0	3
pizza	average pizza, a bit burnt, the waiting time was supposed to be 20 minutes and it was 45. the staff did not even know if i had settled the payment.	0	3
pizza	pizza ok. the nagner did not give a quiet read menu, we entered because they had a blanket and fire and in january evening a big + after we entered the waiter-nagner disappeared when i went inside to place the order because there was no waiter, 3-4 tables were occupied after ordering beer and pizza we've been waiting for pizza almost 40 minutes ...	0	3
pizza	however, the pizza didn't knock me down.. pizza should be an asset to return or enter their next place.	0	3
pizza	you can order pizza (but it's not a super thin crust), pasta (good but not amazing), gyros, soups, coffee and desserts.	0	4

salad	carrots, sweet salad, sweet ukrainian borscht.	-1	1
salad	chicken salad is a failure.	-1	1
salad	i have always appreciated aioli, a very nice place with a kitchen that suits my taste, but after the last visit i was a bit disappointed when it comes to prices ... basic burger 37 zlotys, caesar salad with chicken 42 zlotys, freshly squeezed juice ... diluted with water, pilsner beer 17 zlotys.. as long as the price of the burger can be forgiven, because it was tasty and with additives, the price of the salad is a cosmos, a few leaves of lettuce and not all 100g of chicken for pln 42.	-1	3
salad	i'm sorry, but i have to admit it was the worst caesar salad i have ever eaten.	-1	3
salad	food tasty, one suggestion for a children's dish, i would not give a salad with hot sauce, but for example, delicious baked vegetables that my husband received for his tenderloin.	0	5
salad	medium fresh salads, all mixed together so it was hard to tell them apart.	0	3
salad	nice to start the restaurant with goma wakame seaweed salad.	0	3
salad	i don't know what's going on but it's always been very good recently some totoala lime burger for pln 50 very poor and the meat of madness did not do shrimp salad pln 45 lettuce and vegetables for a shrimp medicine 5 medium-sized lemonade for pln 16 water with with lemon concentrate and ice, i don't know what's going on but we left surprised	0	3
salad	the apple salad was okay (3/5) but the rabbit dumplings were not very good.	0	3

salad	shakshuka and salad phenomenal.	1	5
pad thai	food has always been very mediocre here but the chicken pad thai was plain.	-1	1
pad thai	pad thai with salty tofu, as if covered with vinegar.	-1	1
pad thai	extremely greasy ramen soup which gave me food poisoning, and the worst tasting pad thai we‚Äôve ever had, sloppily presented with very few fresh ingredients.	-1	1
pad thai	pad thai was total disaster, the smell, the taste, also the most ugly dish i've ever had.	-1	1
pad thai	in pad thai with prawns and squid, i found two prawns and three pieces of squid.	-1	3
pad thai	to sum up, if you choose a dish, i recommend shrimps instead of meat because at least the prawns that were in the starter were great (our dishes are pad thai with chicken and stir fry noodles with beef) and of course to justify the main dishes were of a weak, uniform taste, of course beautifully presented but it did not defend itself	0	2
pad thai	pad thai tasty, good taste, although i ate better.. the most expensive pad thai, which i ate in poland	0	4
pad thai	pad thai with pork is probably unique	0	3
pad thai	"i went for the supposedly ""best vegan pad thai"" as it turned out later, maybe it would be good, but the amount of oil exceeded its taste."	0	4
pad thai	long waiting time, as it turned out later, was a very average pad thai.	0	1
pad thai	i recommend pad thai	1	5
pad thai	carbonara is very good, pad thai is spicy in my opinion.	1	5
pad thai	i will risk saying that here is the best pad thai in gda≈Ñsk.	1	5
pad thai	food delicious, beef ramen and chicken pad thai were great!	1	4
pad thai	the best pad thai in the tri-city	1	5
chicken	raw chicken that you give to the child.. too cold fries and raw chicken.	-1	1
chicken	bad service (nothing friendly, fun and hrc exciting); appetizers came after 30min - hair on the chicken wings; main dishes after over 1 hour‚Ä¶ another hit on the stake‚Ä¶.	-1	1
chicken	"fewer employees (long waiting time for the waiter, drinks served almost at the same time as the food), poorer quality of ingredients (maybe only i came across such an ""ugly"" piece of chicken in a burger?)"	-1	1
chicken	chicken grilled a few days ago and cruelly salty.	-1	3
chicken	old and seasoned chicken.	-1	1

chicken	massacre, a portion for a child, i left that hungry for two pieces of chicken in pasta.	0	1
chicken	i have always appreciated aioli, a very nice place with a kitchen that suits my taste, but after the last visit i was a bit disappointed when it comes to prices ... basic burger 37 zlotys, caesar salad with chicken 42 zlotys, freshly squeezed juice ... diluted with water, pilsner beer 17 zlotys.. as long as the price of the burger can be forgiven, because it was tasty and with additives, the price of the salad is a cosmos, a few leaves of lettuce and not all 100g of chicken for pln 42.	0	3
chicken	chicken tomato paste üçÖ, just a little üçÖ, zero üêî !	0	3
chicken	a big disadvantage, if the menu with meat is only chicken breast and veal brisket, it is unacceptable that one of these dishes is missing, and so it happened that the brisket is missing.	0	3

chicken	first class food, mmmm salad, heaven in mouth chicken ü§©ü•∞ very nice service.	1	5

pulled pork	my partner‚Äôs pulled pork was dry and heavily sauced seemingly to cover up how dry it was, and my fish and chips were so bland.	-1	3
pulled pork	bao rolls with pulled pork - very weak: the meat is cold, the rolls are usually steamed cooked.	-1	2
pulled pork	unfortunately, the take-out pulled pork burger was far from perfect or even decent.	-1	2

pulled pork	we used pulled pork rolls.	0	4

pulled pork	the kids are delighted, and what is more important, children's dishes with vegetables ... with minuses is a slightly pulled pork loin ... but we will come back anyway.	0	5
pulled pork	"big reservations about pulled pork fries.. by the words pulled pork we associate rather ""disintegrated"" juicy meat."	0	3
pulled pork	we chose shrimp and pulled pork burgers as main courses.	1	5
pulled pork	pulled pork was my favorite though.	1	4

pulled pork	delicious food, in the pictures duck buns, kimchi pulled pork and pulled pork.	1	5
pulled pork	beautiful place, friendly service, we especially recommend mango curry bowl, kimchi pulled pork and hottie.	1	5
curry	i must say that i was unfortunately disappointed with the taste of the soups and curry stews, they were very vague.	-1	2
curry	the worst red curry i've ever eaten.	-1	1
curry	green curry is a box full of oil.....really unhealthy and bad....	-1	1
curry	the food was not good (pad thai and shrimp curry).. there was not a single shrimp in the shrimp curry.	-1	1
curry	we ordered a chicken curry with soy noodles and a thai soup with a friend.	0	1
curry	green chicken curry also nice, rich in additives.	0	3
curry	the rest did it - spring rolls, curry chicken, ribs ok. not outstanding, but tasty.	0	3
curry	unfortunately, the green curry chicken i received is far from what i have always ordered.	0	3
curry	curry and mango curry without any frenzy, more home-made than asian.	0	2
curry	the yellow curry was also polonized, but tasty nonetheless, and it was 3 stars.. as for the prices of 2x pho soup and 2x curry, it was around pln 120.	0	3
curry	i loved both the curry, and the ramen.	1	5
curry	the mango curry bowl was delicious, velvety, aromatic, slightly spicy and slightly sweet at the same time.	1	5
curry	this place is at a great location the staff here are very nice and friendly.i am vegan so you have  food for everyone.i had the tofu bao set and my wife had the mango curry.plus we ordered for drinks and sweet potato fries.all of it was very good.the place has good atmosphere and they are very quick with the food.overall i would highly recommend this place.	1	5
curry	mango-curry flavor - perfectly balanced.	1	5
curry	beautiful place, friendly service, we especially recommend mango curry bowl, kimchi pulled pork and hottie.	1	5
potato pancakes	a very small portion, for example: 3 potato pancakes: o ... additionally, dripping with fat ... service is a big plus, but the service automatically added to the receipt spoils everything.	-1	1
potato pancakes	the potato pancakes were very greasy of the pork tenderloin that was as good for a cat as it was and was generally bland.	-1	1
potato pancakes	yesterday i ate the main dish of the day, broth, which i have no objection to because it was tasty, but for the main course i took dumplings and potato pancakes that could not be eaten not only that they were burnt, they had to be fried in a very large amount of lard.	-1	1
potato pancakes	potato pancakes are made from potato flour, not real potatoes.	-1	1
potato pancakes	the second course - salted, flour potato pancakes, chicken breast coating in old fat.	-1	1
potato pancakes	there were only 3 potato pancakes.	0	3
potato pancakes	on the other hand, i ordered potato pancakes with salmon and - i should take into account that there will be a lot of dill in polish, potato cuisine, but i have the impression that it spilled twice too much :) nevertheless, my fault is that i did not ask for a dish without dill which i do not like .. however, at the moment when i tried the potato pancakes and a hair came out of them, the rating dropped drastically by 2 eyes.	0	3
potato pancakes	good compote, potato pancakes, etc.	0	3
potato pancakes	the only plus was the food, the potato pancakes were tasty.	0	3
potato pancakes	other toppings like potato pancakes and salad were ok.	0	2
potato pancakes	the potato pancake with smoked trout was absolutely masterful - i consider myself a master of potato pancakes and this one tasted as good as mine üòã the octopus for the main course was also perfectly cooked, and the celery ice cream for dessert surprised us with its unobvious taste.	1	5
potato pancakes	potatoes are served in various variants: potato pancakes, casseroles, or in uniforms, and a choice of various meat or vegetable sauces.. a very big plus for the waiting time: i ordered my dish and in 10 minutes i had delicious, crispy and golden potato pancakes.	1	5
potato pancakes	food lumpy, potato pancakes very good, dumplings sticking together badly, so there was a lot of water inside.	1	3
potato pancakes	the potato pancakes were tasty, the git casserole, you can fill up.	1	5
potato pancakes	very tasty potato pancakes.	1	5
lasagne	at first half of the dishes on the menu are not available, then wait 45 minutes for food and then get a disgusting and cold lasagne.	-1	1
lasagne	laughable lasagne, do you serve the same on site, or just for takeaway?	-1	1
lasagne	we are with a partner, a fan of italian cuisine, and this creation in the photo called lasagne bolognese next to bolognese did not even stand.	-1	1
lasagne	lasagne was microwaved.	-1	2
lasagne	we had margarita pizza and lasagne, which is supposed to be their speciality.	-1	2
lasagne	the linguine with clams, lasagne, veal & eggplant parmagianas were nowhere near the quality it used to be.	0	1
lasagne	the pizza is good, but the spinnaker lasagne is not recommended.	0	4
lasagne	my advice: if an adult takes lasagne bolonese for himself, i suggest ordering a double portion right away.	0	4
lasagne	lasagne perfectly ok but take something else.	0	5
lasagne	thin crust pizza, lasagne - i haven't eaten that for a long time.	0	5

risotto	my husband ordered black fish risotto - it was a complete failure.	-1	1
risotto	i was expecting something better ..... starter of fish poached in oil, and seafood risotto overcooked and without the taste of the sea.	-1	3
risotto	salmon ok, but the risotto underneath it left a lot to be desired.	-1	3
risotto	risotto with peas, tomato and leek served with salmon in march, very weak.	-1	3
risotto	the risotto was more like cheese rice and had so much parmesean (a very salty cheese) that we really couldn't eat more than a few bites.	-1	3
risotto	hungarian pancake unpalatable for me, risotto terribly dry frozen vegetables.	0	2
risotto	i ordered their fabulous risotto and immediately i notice that it looked different.	0	3
risotto	risotto with vegetables and chicken dry and reheated several times, medium food.	0	3
risotto	the service was nice and professional, the dishes were presented well, but what if after eating tapas with seafood, risotto for two and desserts, the visit ended with acute food poisoning, which is unacceptable in such a place !!!	0	1
risotto	good food, but not cauliflower risotto.	0	5
risotto	we were not disappointed either, because the cauliflower risotto and the mutton burger were very delicious and nicely served.	1	5
risotto	great atmosphere, perfect service of mrs. magdalena, and the food is delicious, burgers, soup, risotto, everything buttoned up to the last button.	1	5
risotto	the seafood risotto brought you to your knees.	1	5
risotto	big wow for the tartare and the tuna one and the deer one ... the seafood risotto is a masterpiece.	1	5
risotto	the burrata was delicious and so was the risotto.	1	4
steak	i was not able to eat my dish, but the boyfriend ate his steak because he did not eat all day, even though it was impossible to even cut it and if it were not for the tasty sauce, eat it.	-1	1
steak	a steak for pln 99 looks like from a roadside bar.	-1	1
steak	the 110 pln steak was tasteless as was the sauce.	-1	3
steak	steaks are nothing but fat, just terrible	-1	1
steak	steak was served rare which our group did not like- we weren't asked about temperature prior to being served and nobody checked on us during our meal to make sure everything came out okay so we couldn't even ask for it to be cooked more.	-1	1
steak	the steaks are gone .. the fish .. today we just left the restaurant after a few minutes of studying the menu.	0	3
steak	the steak toppings are great.	0	4
steak	a friend's steak was fine, but the baked potato was tasteless to him.	0	3
steak	squid steak was nicely cooked, too many onions and looked like cuttlefish.. steak tartare was okay, beef salad too sweet.	0	3
steak	the osage menu is a basic steak house menu and the wait staff is attired like they work at luby's but you will still pay like you are at a high end restaurant.	0	3
steak	everything on the menu is the same - supreme chicken, burgers and steaks‚Ä¶.	1	5
steak	we ordered beef serloin steak.	1	5
steak	the steak melted in my mouth.	1	5
steak	a very climatic place, good dishes (delicious pasta and steaks), prices - know, quite high but you pay for prestige.	1	3
steak	great steak	1	5
tortilla	i ordered a kebab without olives, i got olives .... for this price you really expected something specific, not a cake wrapped in tortillas and fries with meat.	-1	1
tortilla	meat and tortilla were cold two identical kebabs in one, fries were in the other, unfortunately not.	-1	1
tortilla	after a long wait i got a dry kebab with no sauce in a burnt tortilla.	-1	1
tortilla	taco was had a terrible tortilla, however the patio has a great location.	-1	3
tortilla	i have practically not found the meat in the tortilla.. the tortillas were poorly folded and falling apart.	-1	1
tortilla	i ordered a whole wheat tortilla and i got it usually.	0	1
tortilla	my daughter‚Äôs quesadillas came with a side of tortilla chips so i enjoyed those with the queso.	0	5
tortilla	none of the dishes were amazing and they gave a lot of unnecessary tortilla chips between courses.	0	3
tortilla	through delicious.pl i ordered feta tortilla with additional meat.. there was no sign of feta or any sauce in the tortilla.	0	3
tortilla	i take 2 stars for the price - over pln 50 for 2 medium-sized tortillas is definitely too much.	0	3
tortilla	the homemade tortillas are delicious though, but the place seems to be popping mostly because of its location and big terrasse, especially during sunny days.	1	3
tortilla	we were especially enamored of the appetizers in the lounge = oyster, chicharr√≥n, tortilla soup, and tiny empanada , the venison carpaccio so full of flavor, the extra course of crispy duck (so good!)	1	5
tortilla	check out the pecan pie, and those hand made tortillas!	1	5
tortilla	impossibly delicious peanut cream and great tortilla.	1	5
tortilla	"tortilla with ""kebab"" delicious but a hit was the eggplant dish."	1	5

fish	fish & chips dry and hard, blue tartare, dirty in the bathroom, cables sticking out of the walls.	-1	1
fish	overpriced soggy fish and cold fries!	-1	1
fish	after the first bite we thanked, the fish (tuna) was spoiled and simply smelled.	-1	1
fish	the steaks are gone .. the fish .. today we just left the restaurant after a few minutes of studying the menu.	0	3
fish	it was much worse with the second courses ... the fish soup turned out to be rather vegetable, and the carbonara pasta was floating in the sauce and it was easier to eat with a spoon.	0	3
fish	we ordered fish and panko chicken.. it is worth asking about the fish, because all the items on the menu turned out to be frozen.. and my fish landed on the next table ... then it came back to the kitchen ...... and then back to me ..... as my plate wandered, the fish wasn't hot anymore .... the waiter only at the end of our meal asked if everything was ok .....	0	3
fish	i think steaks can be good, but for fish and chips it is 3 plus.	0	3
fish	fish is okay, prices are also affordable.	0	3
fish	delicious dumplings, great fish in excellent breadcrumbs, friendly service, only pluses, no minuses	1	5
fish	i have never eaten such a good fish!. fish soup also very tasty, well seasoned.	1	5
fish	very good fish and other dishes, affordable prices and adequate for the quality and location	1	5
fish	we wanted something a bit more homely, with fresh fish on offer and a relaxed atmosphere.	1	5
fish	the fish is very good, the soup even more so, generous portions at a moderate price.	1	5
pancakes	pancakes burnt on the bottom in a way that indicates heating, not fresh preparation.	-1	1
pancakes	tasty tripe but as for the main course, it is a pity that i ordered them, i had pork tenderloin with blanched vegetables, they were cauliflower, carrots and broccoli, it is a pity that at this time of the year the cook uses frozen vegetables, on top of that they were overcooked summer and tasteless and the pancakes were also, unfortunately, frozen and extra soaked fry	-1	1
pancakes	3 stars for weak pancakes zero crunchiness from a lot of fat i know it's a fast food bar but you can try better.	-1	3
pancakes	terrible pancakes, without expression, only the jam saved them.	-1	1
pancakes	we ordered typically breakfast food french toast and my daughter had pancakes.. my daughter pancakes were cold.	-1	1
pancakes	before we could order breakfast, our children were already very hungry, so we took out their milk bottles and banana pancakes that we had with us.	0	1
pancakes	there were only 3 potato pancakes.	0	3
pancakes	we came very hungry and left full, without ordering pancakes which we also wanted.	0	5
pancakes	food presented very nice, i highly recommend the nachos... are waiter chris aka fred was outstanding... well worth the visit... will be returning for pancakes...	0	3
pancakes	good compote, potato pancakes, etc.. the pancakes could be baked on the fly, sometimes they are fried.	0	3
pancakes	we went for breakfasts (full english, beef bagel, pancakes).	1	5
pancakes	the potato pancake with smoked trout was absolutely masterful - i consider myself a master of potato pancakes and this one tasted as good as mine üòã the octopus for the main course was also perfectly cooked, and the celery ice cream for dessert surprised us with its unobvious taste.	1	5
pancakes	food presented very nice, i highly recommend the nachos... are waiter chris aka fred was outstanding... well worth the visit... will be returning for pancakes...	1	5
pancakes	then the main course: tenderloin in chanterelle sauce on potato pancakes - a fairy tale!. everything freshly made, golden pancakes, soft and juicy meat.	1	5
pancakes	pancakes with cottage cheese and fruit - delicious, pork chop with potatoes and salad, great location, affordable prices.	1	5
ravioli	had to send back my wife's ravioli and broccolini because it was cold.	-1	2
ravioli	risotto was a bit too greasy/salty and not the right consistency for our taste, the ravioli was bland.	-1	2
ravioli	the ravioli was very lukewarm and watery.	-1	2
ravioli	The son ordered ravioli with saffron sauce and another one with tomato sauce.	-1	1
ravioli	meat ravioli with tomato sauce was meh.	-1	3
ravioli	i was interested in an off-the-menu dish, but i forgot to ask about the price and i paid 70 zlotys for a piece of meat and three ravioli.	0	3
ravioli	i expected better ravioli, and the dumplings did not surprise me with anything special.	0	3
ravioli	ravioli average, coffee was horrible	0	3
ravioli	both of our mains (the ravioli and the steak ) were very average and underwhelming.. i could get over that if the quality was above par, but i've seriously made store bought ravioli and pasta sauce that tasted better.	0	3
ravioli	fish was overcooked and ravioli lackluster.	0	3
ravioli	different impressions because the ravioli are delicious and the cod with chips was clearly frozen, dripping with fat and terribly over-salt, the waiting time for food was very long.	1	3
ravioli	focaccia with three pastes and ravioli, spinach and ricotta + white wine was very tasty.	1	5
ravioli	delicious ravioli.	1	5
ravioli	very good pasta and ravioli only quite high prices üòå	1	5
ravioli	excellent place to taste the typical polish ravioli!. very modern and bright environment, the ravioli are handmade in the kitchen.	1	5
bowl	bao buns are great, bowls with rice are great.. but recently i had a chance to try a bowl with rice noodles in vietnamese sauce.	-1	3
bowl	their buns are quite ok, but keep away from bowls, if you are into real asian rice bowls, not soups!!. the amount of ‚Äòbowl sauce‚Äô is just ridiculous, everything floats, or rather sinks like titanic under it	-1	2
bowl	the meat bowl is a mistake - very salty chicken, red cabbage so salty that it is almost inedible.	-1	2
bowl	noodle bowl is a joke, a mix of salads, a few slices of (good) beef, but nothing else, a sauce based on water and vinegar, which is not compatible with the rest of the salad, if i wanted to eat a salad, i would order a salad.	-1	1
bowl	the burritos, chicken and beef bowl were really not good.	-1	1
bowl	 delicious shrimp bao rolls, and miso soup as well, while the sushi bowl is a slight misunderstanding that should not bear such a name, just a bowl of rice with lettuce and a few pieces of salmon, seasonal tea so sweet that you could not drink it	0	3
bowl	this place lacks a real mexican food, but the fact that you can eat for less than pln 30 - a grande burrito or all kinds of bowls is quite a decent portion of food	0	3
bowl	at some point, you are left with half a bowl of sterile pasta.	0	3
bowl	pepper-mushroom soup is great and delicious, but a bit drenched in hundreds of pepper balls in one bowl	0	4
bowl	burrito bowl okay, the meat was a little bit and that's what bothered me the most, the biggest problem was in the sauce (tomato) a lot of it everywhere and it only spoils the taste, my suggestion would be to add a cream-based sauce to the menu (i've already met one in mexican restaurants) then it would be fun and i could eat more often	0	2
bowl	 delicious bowls!	1	4
bowl	interesting and tasty company dishes in bowls, unfortunately the mulled wine was cold.	1	4
bowl	it quickly became clear where such crowds came from :) everything we ate was delicious and carefully prepared, we especially liked the bowl with kimchi.	1	5
bowl	 very nice and professional service, (which does not always go hand in hand), only completed the sensational experience provided by the feast of bowl kimchi flavors.	1	5
bowl	delicious kimchi bowl!	1	5
beef	in my life i have never eaten seafood or beef worse.	-1	1
beef	pasta overcooked, chicken dry and not even like chicken, and so is beef.	-1	1
beef	 hotel oki unfortunately a visit to a restaurant and ordering roast beef was a mistake the dish was presented nicely, unfortunately it was impossible to eat it.	-1	3
beef	delicious fish soup, beef brisket too intense in taste, as well as additives, so nothing fits together.	-1	3
beef	pork, beef, shrimp, fish and chicken were alll horrible.	-1	1
beef	steak tartare was okay, beef salad too sweet.	0	3
beef	asian noodles with beef - pln 42, falafel burger pln 29 and cola pln 9	0	3
beef	food - very tasty snacks fillo rolls and tzatziki, main course - beef kebap - ok, very salty skewers.	0	3

seafood	rubbery seafood ...	-1	1
seafood	cold, salty, dragged ... seafood is not their cup of tea.	-1	1
seafood	i ordered a seafood dish, super salty.	-1	1
seafood	dish: tagliatelle with seafood, delivery.	-1	2
seafood	thai seafood soup is a joke - only 2 shrimps 2 mussels for 34 zl.	-1	2
seafood	service and cocktails was really good, but seafood plato was to far away from our expectations.	0	2
seafood	covid protocols have transformed this beloved waterfront seafood and chowder house into a sub-par fast-food (slow-food) joint.	0	2
seafood	however, the seafood platter we ordered for the main course turned out to be very average.	0	3
seafood	only seafood dishes.	0	3
seafood	their kids menu was 90% seafood.	0	3
seafood	best seafood we have ever eaten !!!	1	5
seafood	the seafood risotto and spaghetti bolognese were really good.	1	5
seafood	we were on the road on i95 north and asked siri for a five star seafood restaurant near and we end up to fire & wine.	1	5
seafood	a great place with delicious, fresh seafood.	1	5
seafood	nice service, atmospheric place, 1st class drinks and seafood delicious!	1	5
falafel	there was nothing else in the falafel wrap, except dry lettuce, two slices of cucumber, and i found one red onion ring.. and uninteresting falafels.	-1	1
falafel	the worst falafel kebab i've had in my life.. i don't know if the falafel was old, weathered, not thawed or what - at least it was inedible and i had to throw it away	-1	1
falafel	cold kebab, vegetarian kebs, no meat alternative, no salads, no falafel !!!	-1	1
falafel	the falafel kabab was uneatable with this sauce and went most of the trash.	-1	1
falafel	the falafel was dry, the beer glass was stinking with a dirty cloth.	-1	3
falafel	recently ordered drinking falafels and my favorite dish from this restaurant.. in the middle, almost all beetroot, some soy sauce, falafels (quite tasty) but this dish is not fresh anymore, it is dry.	0	3
falafel	available vegetarian options: veg-only, or falafel.	0	2
falafel	yesterday i got some falafel that's super spicy, they changed it, the new version was not grounded well at all, many pieces of whole chickpeas are inside, hard.. i usually love falafel, this time it's really an exception.	0	3
falafel	the fries are fried, the sauces are very medium, the falafel falls apart and is not very tasty (but the best of all).	0	2
falafel	falafel plate quite ok, but the eggplant with te avivu terrible, eggplant in a very sweet sauce, could not be eaten.	0	3
falafel	falafel was good but the place did the beers neat and horrible customer service	1	2
falafel	delicious falafels and power bowls.	1	5
falafel	the best falafels in the tri-city, good atmosphere, good people, every section of the card is full of surprises.	1	5
falafel	we also took 2 portions of falafels to go - exemplary.	1	5
falafel	as for the food itself, the falafel and hamburger was very good.	1	3
ramen	"""ramen"" was tasteless (both decoction and vegetables) was nothing like the picture."	-1	1
ramen	unfortunately, the ramen was terrible, bittersweet, the nudle was one solid lump.	-1	1
ramen	extremely greasy ramen soup which gave me food poisoning, and the worst tasting pad thai we‚Äôve ever had, sloppily presented with very few fresh ingredients.	-1	1
ramen	they should cut off the chef's hands for spaghetti in ramen !!!	-1	3
ramen	the same goes for ramen.	-1	3
ramen	good beer, average ramen.	0	2
ramen	correct, but the ramen-typical additions were missing in both ramen.	0	3
ramen	very average ramen, not to say weak, too hot, cold, poor additions for this price, i do not recommend it.	0	2
ramen	to sum up‚Ä¶ ramen very average, fat with water, meat is a misunderstanding‚Ä¶.	0	3
ramen	if someone is looking for good old ramen here - unfortunately, he will not find it here.. ramen vol 2 is a misunderstanding.. vege ramen is much more varied, but don't be fooled, it also doesn't taste great.	0	3
ramen	i loved both the curry, and the ramen.	1	5
ramen	ramen is great, want to try other dishes!	1	5
ramen	burgers, waffles and ramen rock!	1	5
ramen	great ramen.	1	5
ramen	delicious vegan tartare and ramen.	1	5
bao	bao rolls with pulled pork - very weak: the meat is cold, the rolls are usually steamed cooked.	-1	2
bao	we ordered a shrimp bowl and a set of bao scones.	-1	1
bao	far away from a real bao‚Ä¶ disappointed	-1	2
bao	i ordered a set of bao, asking to make it without sauce and onion due to a health condition.. we had to wait for the order for over half an hour and the bao were still served with sauce	-1	3
bao	when it comes to desserts, pingpong broke down a lot, once my favorite dessert was bao with ice cream, this time much worse, brilliant coconut ice cream replaced with mediocre vanilla ice cream.	-1	2
bao	i chose üëâ bao set #lunch set 2 x bao tofu / chicken / beef and fries / miso soup.. i had the bao tofu and chicken and miso soup.	0	1
bao	bao buns came out especially fast, most likely skipping corners, the beef looked old and was cold	0	1
bao	unfortunately, the shrimp bao was very average - 3 shrimps + rolls with mayonnaise salad poured over another portion of mayonnaise - shrimps must be eaten separately because otherwise it is impossible to eat them, so they are rolled with mayonnaise, there were 3 mini leaves of coriander, the taste was imperceptible.	0	3
bao	great service, burger very weak, fish pesto ok, bao buns ... average.	0	3
bao	we praised the large portion of tea very much :) bao buns are tasty but they fell apart very much, prices too high.	0	3
bao	bao soft and delicious as well.	1	5
bao	this place is at a great location the staff here are very nice and friendly.i am vegan so you have  food for everyone.i had the tofu bao set and my wife had the mango curry.plus we ordered for drinks and sweet potato fries.all of it was very good.the place has good atmosphere and they are very quick with the food.overall i would highly recommend this place.	1	5
bao	delicious shrimp bao rolls, and miso soup as well, while the sushi bowl is a slight misunderstanding that should not bear such a name, just a bowl of rice with lettuce and a few pieces of salmon, seasonal tea so sweet that you could not drink it	1	5
bao	bao is very light and tasty.	1	5
bao	the bao rolls tasted the same a year ago and now and if i want them, i can be sure that i will get what i expect.. bao buns are, in my opinion, the best on the menu, especially those with prawns.	1	5
burger	"fewer employees (long waiting time for the waiter, drinks served almost at the same time as the food), poorer quality of ingredients (maybe only i came across such an ""ugly"" piece of chicken in a burger?). and definitely smaller portions (a burger much smaller, a dry roll )."	-1	1
burger	unfortunately, it is not the same aioli as it used to be, after my last visit to which i invited my daughters on the occasion of the children's day, i was very disappointed, the hamburger i received, despite the abundant interior, was packed in a cold roll, which spoiled the whole taste, and the apogee was serving coffee iced with whipped cream, which was fermented, sour and even sparkling.	-1	1
burger	really really really bad personel, bad atmosphere, very looooong time of waiting for everything, cold inside and the worst thing is that burger was expensive and also really bad - long story short everything here was bad and i don't recommend at all.	-1	1
burger	we ordered a burger, the meat stank and the taste was broken.	-1	1
burger	unfortunately the burgers are not as good as they look.	-1	1
burger	unfortunately, for the last few months the menu has been limited to items like .. um .. i would say bar-style .. burgers appeared, for example.	0	3
burger	the burger is now with a sweet big bun, the filling itself is not enough.	0	3
burger	i have always appreciated aioli, a very nice place with a kitchen that suits my taste, but after the last visit i was a bit disappointed when it comes to prices ... basic burger 37 zlotys, caesar salad with chicken 42 zlotys, freshly squeezed juice ... diluted with water, pilsner beer 17 zlotys.. as long as the price of the burger can be forgiven, because it was tasty and with additives, the price of the salad is a cosmos, a few leaves of lettuce and not all 100g of chicken for pln 42.	0	3
burger	 we were yesterday and we ordered 3 burgers which were average :( the sauce for the fries was delicious and the fries :) and as for burgers, there is a lot going on on the plate, but on average everything fits together e.g.	0	2
burger	burger - average, mostly cold, other dishes have defended themselves.	0	3
burger	everything on the menu is the same - supreme chicken, burgers and steaks‚Ä¶.	1	5
burger	very good messi burger, smaller than picture though, good service, next time nornal burger	1	5
burger	i came with my friends for a burger, they all had time to eat and i waited and waited (35 minutes).. the burger itself is great	1	3
burger	we went for starters, burgers and pifka, which is great for me.	1	5
burger	very good bbq burger and snacks.. there are fries with the burger and the whole burger with fries is a really huge portion.	1	5
dessert	pear and parsley soup was inedible, desserts that were once insane at this point are a failure.	-1	1
dessert	desserts 2/5 drenched in juicy chocolate sauce and whipped cream - welcome to the 90s	-1	1
dessert	awful dishes, no decent desserts and salty prices.	-1	1
dessert	riverside dym i ogie≈Ñ = really disappointed > desserts not worth eatingüòû > but to be fair the place and personal was cosy and kind.	-1	2
dessert	my mother and i went to the restaurant to taste coffee and dessert, we didn't try the dishes.	-1	1
dessert	but we came back for dessert in the form of ice cream .. actually .. everything would be ok .. if not for the bill .. the menu shows an ice cream dessert in the amount of pln 12. however, there was 18 pln on the bill.	0	3
dessert	without the sauce the ribs are anything, then with my hands full of sauce for the ribs it lasted half an hour that they came to attend to me to order dessert (the only good thing about the place) they never gave me napkins.	0	1
dessert	tasty dessert, but inadequate in terms of size compared to the price.	0	3
dessert	i'd give a 4 as there is a very small selection of desserts and veggies but the prices are affordable and the service is always nice so a 5 is ok. good location.	0	5
dessert	plus a free dessert in compensation	0	3
dessert	it makes sense if someone wants to enjoy a starter, main course and dessert (all at a high level), otherwise there is a lot of hunger (the photo shows the main course - squid schnitzel).	1	3
dessert	brilliant food, from soup to dessert, all delicious.	1	5
dessert	i had the pleasure of tasting only the desserts because we came to the place to drink coffee and eat something sweet, but both the cake and the way of serving and the portion size at the highest level.. i highly recommend it to fans of rock music, but also to everyone else because i have never eaten a better dessert, and the other dishes also smelled and looked delicious.	1	5
dessert	amazing food, both drinks and desserts.	1	5
dessert	the waiter offered dessert as an apology.. a very large dessert!	1	5
sushi	tasteless sushi, the rolls were falling apart	-1	1
sushi	tasteless chicken ramen, disappointing sushi.	-1	2
sushi	i am very disappointed, i ordered sushi for delivery, the quality of the products is not the best or fresh, the tempura shrimp rolls were soaked, all the rolls were falling off dry reams and i had the impression that it was sour.. i do not recommend it, the worst sushi i have ever eaten ...	-1	1
sushi	"inept imitation of a ""sushi restaurant"""	-1	1
sushi	as for sushi, even in supermarkets they can roll it up better, the whole set is packed in a small box, which made everything stick together and there was no option to take one piece out with chopsticks.. by far the worst sushi in tri-city.	-1	1
sushi	delicious shrimp bao rolls, and miso soup as well, while the sushi bowl is a slight misunderstanding that should not bear such a name, just a bowl of rice with lettuce and a few pieces of salmon, seasonal tea so sweet that you could not drink it	0	3
sushi	i ordered several different sushi sets from mami sushi.. i have already ordered sushi restaurants in the tri-city and i rate the sets from mami sushi as average.	0	3
sushi	very little space to sit and talk freely over sushi ... a take-and-leave-style restaurant ... the food is average ... neither particularly exquisite nor in my mouth ... is it worth visiting?	0	3
sushi	i ordered the cauliflower and i had to eat it with sushi sticks because they never brought me silverware.	0	1
sushi	looks like a sushi place and some other spots will be added soon.	0	5
sushi	sushi very good, great prices.	1	3
sushi	another dish i love is sushi bowl - rice with fresh salmon, avocado, and salad.	1	5
sushi	good price, good sushi.. most people don't buy sushi every day and can't know everything.	1	3
sushi	wish i golfed here too but the sushi rolls at roys were top 3 all time.	1	5
sushi	roy's serves delicious sushi rolls.	1	5
scrambled eggs	fried eggs, unfortunately, the protein did not have enough time to cut the soy :) scrambled eggs half burnt, half not cut :( tea and coffee ok.	-1	1
scrambled eggs	the scrambled eggs was overcooked and it seemes the chef must have been in a rush.	-1	1
scrambled eggs	i'm sorry, but unfortunately the breakfast is very bad, we ordered scrambled eggs and asked for it to be more cut and we got completely liquid scrambled eggs.. the lady asked if everything tasted good, we said that unfortunately not because the scrambled eggs were not cut at all, the lady said that she gave the cook as much as the answer we received.	-1	1
scrambled eggs	i reported it to the waiter and asked for scrambled eggs, which were served to me right on the table in a tiny ikea frying pan for children, no plate, no vegetables.	-1	1
scrambled eggs	i haven't eaten such disgusting sausages and uncooked scrambled eggs for a long time ...	-1	1
scrambled eggs	the only thing that did not suit me was the scrambled eggs that were too dry to a chip.	0	3
scrambled eggs	we ordered scrambled eggs with bacon and tomatoes, unfortunately we got scrambled eggs and bacon separately, tomatoes were a separate mini arugula salad.	0	3
scrambled eggs	i just had a simple breakfast: scrambled eggs with bread + butter.	0	3
scrambled eggs	the breakfast was just good (scrambled eggs and sausages), nothing special.	0	4
scrambled eggs	for scrambled eggs i got 3 slices of tomato and one cucumber.. if you fancy a breakfast such as scrambled eggs, frock coat, cottage cheese, that's ok. but if you want to eat something interesting, something other than the daily home menu, i advise against it.	0	3
scrambled eggs	delicious scrambled eggs with bacon and chives to which they give fresh, crispy bread.	1	5
scrambled eggs	delicious breakfasts, scrambled eggs, omelettes, pancakes, toasts, the choice is wide and everyone will like something	1	5
scrambled eggs	eggs benedict or scrambled eggs delicious fresh ... bread would change only to a thin toasted egg and in scrambled eggs should also be bagels, rolls or bread without gluten to choose.	1	3
scrambled eggs	the scrambled eggs were really good and i enjoyed the gnocchi :)	1	5
scrambled eggs	we had the scrambled eggs, waffle sandwich, eggs benedict and shashuka ( a little tangy for me) but good flavour.	1	5
soup	the sour rye soup was supposed to be in bread but it wasn't, unacceptable, i won't even take it out, really terrible.	-1	1
soup	beetroot soup made of cardboard, taste at least strange.	-1	2
soup	fish soup very weak and tiny, and it cost pln 25: /	-1	3
soup	we haven't eaten such a bad soup for a long time :) literally diluted broth with a small amount of pasta, tasteless.	-1	3
soup	they force me the soup by force, the beetle in the soup	-1	1
soup	tomato cream soup - mixed soup, no revelation.	0	1
soup	a very atmospheric place, unfortunately we got the sour rye soup in summer and when it comes to taste it is very average.	0	4
soup	food very well presented, unfortunately wild boar ribs, sour rye soup and fondant very average, meringue on the other hand delicious.	0	3
soup	we ordered onion soup and sour rye soup.	0	1
soup	unfortunately, the sour rye soup does not impress.	0	4
soup	very tasty soup, pizza a little bit plump but it's cool :)) friendly service	1	5
soup	tasty food, delicious sour rye soup, very good cod.	1	3
soup	very nice restaurant great decor, there is a kids' corner and food cossack tomato cream 10/10 will be eaten many times recommend prices git onion soup also extra and mushroom tagiatelle wonderful such a creamy mmhmm people go there	1	5
soup	fish soup also very tasty, well seasoned.	1	5
soup	the tomato cream soup i think was the best i have ever eaten, the pasta with prawns was also very delicious (very delicate prawns) we also ordered other dishes which were also mega.	1	5
hummus	food generally good, but we ordered hummus with vegetables which is terribly sour, the vegetables were underdone and generally nothing interesting, the asparagus is very tough, i guess underdone.	-1	3
hummus	orange juice was ordered (it didn't even taste like an orange) -too much water in it; ((hummus also tasteless; (((.	-1	2
hummus	lamb with hummus not good.	-1	2
hummus	 friendly service, food generally very good, except for the usual hummus, which is served with some main courses - very watery texture, poorly seasoned, it rarely happens that something really does not taste good to me and that was unfortunately such a situation :( i don't know if it was because of the consistency of the dish, or maybe for other reasons, i felt sick for a few hours after the meal	-1	2
hummus	 food generally good, but we ordered hummus with vegetables which is terribly sour, the vegetables were underdone and generally nothing interesting, the asparagus is very tough, i guess underdone.	-1	3
hummus	a very tiny set of mezze, a micro portion of hummus, a handful of pickles, and some sauce.. the hummus itself was slightly bland, tahini hardly felt, there was no feeling of lemon.	0	3
hummus	the menu had zero vegan options- other than a large dollop of hummus and 2 stalks of celery and carrots... to top that exciting menu off, several children were running around like it was a playground.	0	3
hummus	hummus with vegetables for pln 25 is basically hummus with a symbolic vegetable decoration.	0	3
hummus	the hummus that was supposed to be a starter was brought along with the main course.	0	3
hummus	the eggplant hummus however was small and the presentation could be improved.	0	3
hummus	hummus rocks.	1	5
hummus	muze, hummus and kofta very tasty, well presented, very friendly service.	1	4
hummus	recommendable hummus, shakshuka and both types of breakfast - meat and vegetarian.	1	5
hummus	great hummus!	1	5
hummus	wonderful power bowls, hummuses, brownies ... :) i recommend it to everyone!	1	5
spaghetti	i tried the black spaghetti, gnocci, steak.	-1	1
spaghetti	are food finally arrived in my father-in-law who had gotten the salmon had a fairly over cooked fish, i had gotten the scallop dish with three of the smallest scallops i have ever seen, my mother-in-law had the risotto which was very watery, and my husband had the pork and spaghetti dish which was very bland.	-1	2
spaghetti	i ordered spaghetti bolognese - price inadequate to what i got: almost only pasta, traces of meat - definitely not recommended!	-1	2
spaghetti	"spaghetti with meatballs - ""sauce"" looked like someone just poured canned tomatoes over the pasta, the whole thing looked unappetizing."	-1	1
spaghetti	when asked to give me the tastiest dish they have, i got something that resembled spaghetti, but the taste was extremely disgusting.	-1	1
spaghetti	beef cheeks were well cooked, fried spaghetti is not to my taste.	0	3
spaghetti	the pasta was great, and three stars for the fact that i ordered spaghetti and i got tagliatelle like nothing, and it spoiled the whole effect	0	3
spaghetti	i took my friend here for a shared plate of anchovy spaghetti.. the spaghetti was thick and pasty and, although i expected a bit of salt from the anchovies, this w-a-y over the top.	0	3
spaghetti	my daughter really liked the ravioli,  but the rest of us weren't that impressed with the spaghetti,  fettuccine, or mostaccoili  it was fine italian food, but it wasn't anything we hadn't had before or made at home.	0	3
spaghetti	spaghetti with prawns in tomato sauce, sweet, not salty and not at all expressive.	0	3
spaghetti	very good shrimp spaghetti	1	5
spaghetti	the spaghetti tagliatelle with truffles and the caesar salad turned out to be delicious.	1	5
spaghetti	spaghetti with sirloin and molto delicioso porcini mushrooms	1	5
spaghetti	super tasty, and good spaghetti bolognese for the son	1	5
spaghetti	the seafood spaghetti was brilliant.	1	4
dumplings	small dumplings, but the price for this number of pieces is also not great, so i have nothing to do with it.	-1	2
dumplings	the cream soup was quite good, while the russian dumplings tasted like water with dough and were overcooked and served only with cream.. i exchanged dumplings for a salad, serving chicken in this salad is just a joke, just like the ordered aperol, which we didn't get.	-1	1
dumplings	dumplings cold and dry, pasta cold and dry, brussels sprouts - lukewarm and overcooked, beans - cold and with a strange bitter aftertaste, ribs probably spoiled and of course - cold.	-1	1
dumplings	food lumpy, potato pancakes very good, dumplings sticking together badly, so there was a lot of water inside.	-1	3
dumplings	meat dumplings - very dry inside.	-1	1
dumplings	duck dumplings 3+ because they were cold.	0	2
dumplings	pretty tasty dumplings.. unfortunately, the waiting time from the declared 15 minutes was 35. wonton soup inedible - such water after dumplings with 3 tablespoons of salt.	0	2
dumplings	tripe and potato dumplings - both dishes were unfortunately average	0	3
dumplings	i ate dumplings and pielmieni: delicious stuffing, but the doughs were thick and hard.	0	3
dumplings	i am forced to change my opinion, after the last visit i was surprised by a different menu, the fact is that i haven't been there for a long time, but i remember the fried dumplings well.. currently, there are no fried dumplings on the menu.. the dumplings themselves tasty, but earlier it was better.	0	3
dumplings	the gypsy pancake is a revelation, the goulash with potato dumplings is also very tasty.	1	3
dumplings	delicious dumplings, it's a pity there is so little space inside.	1	3
dumplings	the order arrived on time, the dumplings were delicious as usual, but i was not allowed to enjoy the full portion as it came mixed with a different type of dumplings.	1	3
dumplings	very tasty dumplings, nice place, short waiting time, but a big minus for not informing about additional paid extras.. mrs. waitress offers, for example, cream, salads with dumplings - without informing that they are payable	1	3
dumplings	delicious dumplings, worth recommending (we ordered 3 types), but i strongly advise against the sour rye soup: very salty, too thick, with overcooked potatoes inside.	1	3
coffee	nasty barmaid, sloppy coffee.	-1	1
coffee	i do not recommend coffee.	-1	1
coffee	hopeless coffee.	-1	1
coffee	bad coffee.	-1	2
coffee	nice place, very interesting decor, but unfortunately the coffee is bad.	-1	3
coffee	coffee ok .. i have reservations about the amount of coffee in the mug ... not an adiculous amount for the price!	0	1
coffee	their service was good, and the coffee and  food was like okay but the portion was very  small.. we ordered coffee which was with cheaper price when ordered with breakfast but the staff didn't state that my choice of latte wasn't included in the deal, so we ended up with a bill with 20 z≈Ç more.	0	2
coffee	for example only pour over coffee.	0	3
coffee	coffee is so so, but other things are good.	0	3
coffee	 strong coffee, cool place	0	4
coffee	however, the coffee is delicious.	1	1
coffee	but the coffee is good.	1	3
coffee	coffee and matcha very good, we liked the cake too, although we are not very fond of vegan ones.	1	3
coffee	the food is tasty, so is the coffee	1	4
coffee	delicious coffee	1	4
